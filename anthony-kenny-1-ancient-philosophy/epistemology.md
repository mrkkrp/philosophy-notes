# Knowledge and its limits: Epistemology

Epistemology is the inquiry into what can be known, and how we can know it.
What is the mark of genuine knowledge and how does it differ from mere
belief?

## Presocratic Epistemology

* Democritus: the senses do not deliver truths about an independent reality.
  There are only atoms and the void.
* Protagoras: man is the measure of all things. Whatever appears true to a
  particular person is true for that person. All beliefs, therefore, are
  true: but they have only a relative truth. There no such thing as
  independent, objective truth.
* Democritus objected that Protagoras' doctrine was self-refuting. If all
  beliefs are true, then among true beliefs is the belief that not every
  belief is true.
* Democritus: there are two kinds of knowledge, one through the senses and
  one through the intellect. Only intellectual knowledge is legitimate
  knowledge; the five senses deliver only a bastard version. There is,
  however, a problem: the intellectual knowledge expressed in the atomic
  theory is based in part on empirical evidence: and this comes from the
  cheating senses.

## Socrates

* Socrates questions various characters in Plato dialogues refuting their
  claims to knowledge. He does so by producing counter-examples, which can
  take two forms: they can show either that the definition covers more than
  it should, or that it covers less than it should.
* Socrates is looking for *essence* of things.
* Other philosophers in recent times have criticized Socratic insistence on
  knowledge of essences. Wittgenstein pointed out that among the items that
  most interest philosophers some may not have such an essence at all. He
  denied, for instance, that everything we call language possesses one
  feature in common which makes us use the same word for all. Rather, these
  phenomena are related to one another in many different ways, just us
  different members of the same family will resemble each other in different
  features such as build, gait, color, temperament, and so on. Even where X
  does have an essence, being able to define that essence or to articulate
  an exceptionless criterion for distinguishing Xs from not Xs is not a
  necessary condition for being genuinely able to tell an X when one sees
  one. Thus, I can know that a computer is not alive without being able to
  produce a watertight criterion to separate life from non-life. (MK: Can
  you?)

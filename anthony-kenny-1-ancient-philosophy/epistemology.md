# Knowledge and its limits: Epistemology

Epistemology is the inquiry into what can be known, and how we can know it.
What is the mark of genuine knowledge and how does it differ from mere
belief?

## Presocratic Epistemology

* Democritus: the senses do not deliver truths about an independent reality.
  There are only atoms and the void.
* Protagoras: man is the measure of all things. Whatever appears true to a
  particular person is true for that person. All beliefs, therefore, are
  true: but they have only a relative truth. There no such thing as
  independent, objective truth.
* Democritus objected that Protagoras' doctrine was self-refuting. If all
  beliefs are true, then among true beliefs is the belief that not every
  belief is true.
* Democritus: there are two kinds of knowledge, one through the senses and
  one through the intellect. Only intellectual knowledge is legitimate
  knowledge; the five senses deliver only a bastard version. There is,
  however, a problem: the intellectual knowledge expressed in the atomic
  theory is based in part on empirical evidence: and this comes from the
  cheating senses.

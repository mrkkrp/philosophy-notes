# Knowledge and its limits: Epistemology

Epistemology is the inquiry into what can be known, and how we can know it.
What is the mark of genuine knowledge and how does it differ from mere
belief?

## Presocratic Epistemology

* Democritus: the senses do not deliver truths about an independent reality.
  There are only atoms and the void.
* Protagoras: man is the measure of all things. Whatever appears true to a
  particular person is true for that person. All beliefs, therefore, are
  true: but they have only a relative truth. There no such thing as
  independent, objective truth.
* Democritus objected that Protagoras' doctrine was self-refuting. If all
  beliefs are true, then among true beliefs is the belief that not every
  belief is true.
* Democritus: there are two kinds of knowledge, one through the senses and
  one through the intellect. Only intellectual knowledge is legitimate
  knowledge; the five senses deliver only a bastard version. There is,
  however, a problem: the intellectual knowledge expressed in the atomic
  theory is based in part on empirical evidence: and this comes from the
  cheating senses.

## Socrates

* Socrates questions various characters in Plato dialogues refuting their
  claims to knowledge. He does so by producing counter-examples, which can
  take two forms: they can show either that the definition covers more than
  it should, or that it covers less than it should.
* Socrates is looking for *essence* of things.
* Other philosophers in recent times have criticized Socratic insistence on
  knowledge of essences. Wittgenstein pointed out that among the items that
  most interest philosophers some may not have such an essence at all. He
  denied, for instance, that everything we call language possesses one
  feature in common which makes us use the same word for all. Rather, these
  phenomena are related to one another in many different ways, just us
  different members of the same family will resemble each other in different
  features such as build, gait, color, temperament, and so on. Even where X
  does have an essence, being able to define that essence or to articulate
  an exceptionless criterion for distinguishing Xs from not Xs is not a
  necessary condition for being genuinely able to tell an X when one sees
  one. Thus, I can know that a computer is not alive without being able to
  produce a watertight criterion to separate life from non-life. (MK: Can
  you?)

## Knowledge in the Theaetetus

* Knowledge = perception. There are cases of perception without knowledge
  and knowledge without perception. ‘Colors are not the same as sounds.’
  What does that piece of knowledge come from? It cannot come from the eyes,
  since they cannot see sounds; it cannot come from the ears, since they
  cannot hear colors. Moreover, there are no organs for detecting sameness,
  in the way that there are organs for seeing and hearing. The soul itself
  contemplates the common terms that apply to the deliverances of all of the
  senses.
* Knowledge = thought, and thought is an activity of the soul by itself.
  Knowledge cannot be identified outright with thought, because there are
  false thoughts, but perhaps we can say that knowledge is true thought.
* There are cases when people have true thoughts and form true opinions
  without having actual knowledge.
* Knowledge = true thought + logos. *Logos* is a kind of analysis. If so,
  the ultimate, unanalyzable elements of the universe cannot be known. And
  if elements of a complex cannot be known, how can the complex itself be
  known? Moreover, a mere listing of the elements of a complex is
  insufficient for knowledge unless the elements are put together in the
  correct order.
* Logos = a detailed description that is uniquely true of that object. That
  is a necessary condition for having any thought about X, but it is not
  sufficient for turning a true thought into a piece of genuine knowledge.

## Knowledge and Ideas

* What is known must be true; knowledge can only be of what *is*.
* If knowledge must be knowledge of what *is*, and only an Idea utterly
  *is*, then knowledge must be knowledge of Ideas.
* If there is anything at the opposite pole from an Idea, something that
  utterly *is not*, that is totally unknowable. Most things are only partly
  F for any given idea F, so they are a mix of knowable and unknowable, and
  thus are objects of thought (doxa) as apposed to knowledge.
* Knowledge and thought are powers (dynameis), just as sight and hearing are
  powers. Powers do not have colors or shapes by which we can tell one from
  another. ‘In the case of a power I look only at what it is concerned with
  and what it does to it, and by reference to that I call each the power it
  is.’ Sight is a power to discriminate color, and hearing a power to
  discriminate sound: it is the difference between the objects, color and
  sound, that distinguishes these two powers from each other. Similarly, the
  difference between knowledge and belief is to be determined by noting the
  differences between the two kinds of object with which they deal.
* Doxa (thought) has the visible world as its realm. It has 2 different
  forms and 2 different objects. One form is imagination, whose objects are
  shadows and reflections; another form is belief, whose objects are the
  living creatures about us and the works of nature or of human hands.
* The realm of gnosis (knowledge) is also divided in 2. Knowledge par
  excellence is noesis, or understanding, whose object is the Ideas that are
  the province of the philosopher. But there is also another kind of
  knowledge, typical of the mathematician, to which Plato gives the name
  *dianoia*. The abstract objects of the mathematician share with the Ideas
  the characteristic of eternity and unchangeability: they belong to the
  world of being, not of becoming. But they also share a characteristic with
  ordinary terrestrial objects, namely they are multiple and not single. The
  geometer's circles, unlike the Ideal Circle, can intersect with each
  other.
* The philosophical method is called by Plato ‘dialectic’. It treats
  assumptions not as first principles, but literally as hypotheses, like
  stepping stones or starting points on a journey up to an unhypothetical
  first principle. Having grasped this principle, dialectic goes into
  reverse and, keeping hold of what follows from the principle, finally
  comes down to a conclusion.
* What is it to have knowledge of an Idea, and how such knowledge is
  acquired is never explained. Other dialogues (the Phaedo, the Meno)—put
  forward a startling suggestion to fill this gap. Knowledge of Ideas is
  essentially recollection of acquaintance in an earlier, more spiritual
  life.

## Aristotle on Science and Illusion

* We cannot treat majority opinion as the criterion of truth. If a worldwide
  epidemic broke out, those now called healthy might be outnumbered, and
  there would no longer be reason to accept as true their opinion that honey
  is sweet.
* Aristotle offers a number of criteria for ranking sense-appearances when
  it is necessary to choose between them, the most important of which is
  that a sense has priority when it is judging its proper object. The proper
  object of each sense is defined as being that which cannot be perceived by
  another sense, and that about which it is impossible to be deceived: color
  is the proper sense of sight, sound of hearing, and flavor of taste.
  Statements made on the basis of a given sense can only be corrected by a
  further use of the same sense. If we are not sure whether a thing really
  is the color it looks from here to me now, we check by having a better
  look, by looking closer, by looking in a better light. Each sense is the
  final judge in the case of its proper object, though it has to get into
  the right condition and position to judge.
* Aristotle seeks to avoid both Protagoras' phenomenalism and Plato's
  intellectualism. First there is sensation, and then there is memory;
  memories build up into experience and out of individual experience we form
  a universal concept, which is the basis of both practical skill (techne)
  and theoretical knowledge (episteme).
* For Aristotle, to know something is to be genuinely acquainted with the
  explanation of its being the case and to be aware that it cannot be
  otherwise. It is necessary for demonstrative knowledge to depend on things
  that are true and primitive and immediate and better known than the
  conclusion, to which they must also be prior and of which they must be
  explanatory. A body of scientific knowledge is built up out of
  demonstrations. A demonstration is a particular kind of syllogism: one
  whose premises can be traced back to principles that are true, necessary,
  universal, and immediately intuited. These first, self-evident principles
  are related to the conclusions of science as axioms to theorems.

## Epicurean epistemology

* The 3 criteria of truth are sensations, concepts (prolepsis), and
  feelings.
* Sensation is the foundation for knowledge; senses are infallible with
  regard to their proper objects. A sense cannot even correct its own
  impressions: each impression is of equal reliability and hence whatever
  appears to a sense at any time is true.
* On conflict of impressions: we have two equally valid impressions, but of
  different objects. It is rather the belief that 2 impressions are of the
  same object that is ‘distorted’.
* A concept (prolepsis) is a general notion of what kind of thing is
  signified by a word, e.g. ‘body’, ‘man’, ‘cow’, ‘red’. The ‘pro’ in
  ‘prolepsis’ is meant to indicate that a concept of X is not a set of
  information about X derived from experience, but rather a template by
  which we recognize in advance whether an individual presented in
  experience is or is not an X. Concepts are not things that have to be
  proved: they are themselves employed in any proof. It remains obscure
  whence concepts originate. They cannot be all result of experience since
  they provide the means by which we sort sensations, which are the basis of
  experience. But some of them do seem to be the result of
  experience—perhaps misinterpreted experience, like the concept of God.
* Sensations and concepts are both evident. It is on these evident elements
  that we must base our beliefs in what is not evident. Conjectures and
  theories are false if the senses bear witness against them; they are true
  if they are confirmed by the senses. May not more than one incompatible
  theory be consistent with the evidence? The Epicureans accepted this
  possibility. In such a case all such theories should be accepted: each of
  them is likely to be true in one or other of the many worlds in the
  universe, even if we do not know which is true in our world.

## Stoic Epistemology

* The early Stoics shared a number of assumptions about the nature of
  knowledge with Epicureans. Like them, they believed that it must have a
  dual basis of infallible sense-perception and primitive and acquired
  concepts. Stoics gave an account of origin of concepts close to that of
  Aristotle.
* The Stoics developed a more elaborate classification of mental states than
  ever the Epicureans did. They wanted to propound epistemology that would
  withstand skeptical challenge. In addition to the two states of knowledge
  (episteme) and belief (doxa) that had been contrasted since Plato, they
  introduced a third state, cognition (katalepsis). Knowledge is cognition
  that is sound and firm and unchangeable by argument; belief is weak and
  false assent, and cognition is in between the two: it is assent to a
  cognitive appearance.
* ‘Appearance’ is a broad term, including not only what appears to the
  senses but candidates for belief of other kinds. Cognitions, likewise, may
  result from the senses or from reason. An appearance is not the same thing
  as a belief: belief involves an extra term, namely assent; assent, unlike
  appearance, is a voluntary matter. An appearance is congnitive if it is
  worthy of assent. Cognition is between knowledge and belief in that,
  unlike belief, it is never false, and unlike knowledge, it does not
  involve the resolution never to change one's mind. MK: this does not make
  any sense at all. How is one supposed to be able to tell which appearances
  are cognitive? Further, if a cognitive appearance is never false, then why
  would one ever want to change their mind about it? It is then simply
  knowledge.
* The Stoics classified impressions in terms of their persuasiveness,
  however persuasiveness is not a guarantee of truth.
* There are also reasonable impressions which are compatible with falsehood.
  As if the system wasn't complicated enough.

## Academic Skepticism

* Skeptics are inspired by Socrates.
* There is no true impression arising from sensation that cannot be paired
  with another impression, indistinguishable from it, which is
  non-cognitive. But if two impressions are indistinguishable, it cannot be
  the case that one of them is cognitive and the other not. Therefore no
  impression, even if true, is cognitive. To illustrate this argument,
  consider the case of identical twins, Publius Geminus and Quintus Geminus.
  If someone looking at Publius thinks he is looking at Quintus, he has an
  impression that corresponds in every detail to the one he would have if he
  were if fact looking at Quintus. Hence, his impression is not a cognitive
  one: it does not answer to the final clause of Zeno's definition: ‘of such
  a kind as could not arise from what is not.’
* In reply, the Stoics seem to have denied the possibility of any pair of
  objects resembling each other in every respect. They propounded the thesis
  later known as the identity of indiscernibles: no two grains of sand, no
  two wisps of hair, were totally alike. The Academics complained that the
  thesis was gratuitous; but it surely no more gratuitous than their own
  claim that true impressions are *always* liable to be confused with false
  replicas.
* Arcesilaus: ‘no one should assert or affirm anything or offer it assent;
  instead we should curb our rashness and hold it back from any slip. It
  would be rash indeed to approve something false or unknown, and nothing is
  more disgraceful than to allow assent and approval to outrun cognition.’
* Carneades was less radical. While he rejected the possibility of
  knowledge, he accepted that the wise man could legitimately hold mere
  belief.
* The two Academics focus their attack on Zeno at different points. Zeno
  held that no wise man would hold mere belief, but if he relied only on
  cognitive impressions his assents would all count as knowledge. Arcesilaus
  and Carneades agree with each other that there are no cognitive
  impressions and therefore no knowledge, but the former concludes that the
  wise man will give no assent, while the later concludes that the wise man
  will hold mere belief.
* If the skeptic suspends judgment, how can they live a normal life? To
  answer this question a new notion of *impulse* is introduced. While assent
  is voluntary and can be withheld, appearance, we know, is outside of our
  control. But appearance is inevitably followed by impulse, and it is
  possible to follow this without the mental assent in which truth is to be
  found and falsehood to be avoided.

# How to live: ethics

* Thales: ‘If we do not ourselves do what we blame other for doing.’
* Heraclitus: ‘It is not good for men to get all they want.’
* Heraclitus: ‘A man's character is his destiny.’

## Democritus the moralist

* His ideal was a life of cheerfulness and quiet contentment.
* Democritus praised temperance, but was not an ascetic. Thrift and fasting
  were good, but so was banqueting; the difficulty was judging the right
  time for each.
* The cause of sin is ignorance of what is better.
* You are better off be wronged than doing wrong.

## Socrates on virtue

* Socrates started systematic inquiry into the nature of virtue.
* Socrates often compares and contrasts virtues and skills.
  * Arts and sciences are transmitted through teaching by experts, but there
    do not seem to be any experts who can teach virtue.
  * If the going wrong was making a mistake in the exercise of a skill—e.g.
    playing a false note on the flute, or missing the mark in archery—then
    it is better if it was done on purpose: that is to say, a deliberate
    mistake is not a reflection on one's skill. But things seem different
    when the going wrong is a failure in virtue: it is odd to say that
    someone who violates my rights on purpose is less unjust than someone
    who violates them unwittingly.
* Socrates denies that there are people who sin against virtue on purpose.
  If a man goes wrong he does so through ignorance, through lack of
  knowledge of what is best for him. We all wish to do well and be happy: it
  is for this reason that people want things like health, wealth, power, and
  honor. But these things are only good if we know how to use them well; in
  the absence of this knowledge they can do us more harm than good. This
  knowledge of how best to use what one possesses is wisdom (phronesis) and
  it is the only thing that is truly good. Wisdom is the science of what is
  good and what is bad, and it is identical with virtue—with all the
  virtues.
* For example, actions that exhibit courage are of course different action
  from those that exhibit temperance; but what they express is a single,
  indivisible state of soul. If we say that courage is the science of what
  is good and bad in respect of future dangers, we have to agree that such a
  science is only possible as port of an overall science of good and evil.
  The individual virtues are parts of this science, but it can only be
  possessed as a whole. No one, not even Socrates, is in possession of this
  science.
* Knowledge that an action is evil must be knowledge that, taken with its
  consequences, the action will lead to an excess of pain over pleasure. No
  one with such knowledge is going to undertake such an action; hence the
  person acting wrongly must lack the knowledge. MK: Equating pleasure with
  ‘good’ does not stand. What about wrongdoing which one can get away with?
  Socrates certainly was not familiar with Putin—that man knowingly does all
  kinds of terrible things but he is never held accountable.

## Plato on justice and pleasure

* In Republic Socrates sets out an analogy between the soul and the city. In
  his imagined city virtues are allotted to different classes of the state:
  the city's wisdom is the wisdom of its rulers, its courage is the courage
  of its soldiers, and its temperance is the obedience of the artisans to
  the ruling class. Justice is the harmony of the three classes.
* Later, after introduction of Plato's theory of ideas, a different account
  is presented. The just man is happier than the unjust, not only because
  his soul is in concord, but because it is more delightful to fill the soul
  with understanding than to feed fat the desires of appetite. Reason is no
  longer the faculty that takes care of the person, it is akin to the
  unchanging and immortal world of truth.
* Plato returns to the topic of happiness and pleasure in *Philebus*. At the
  end of the discussion Socrates wins his point against Protarchus: on a
  well-considered grading of good even the best of pleasures come out below
  wisdom. The most interesting part of the dialogue, however, is an argument
  to the effect that neither pleasure nor wisdom can be the essence of a
  happy life, but that only a mixed life that has both pleasure and wisdom
  in it would really be worth choosing.

## Aristotle on eudaimonia

* Aristotle asks ‘what is a good life and how it is to be acquired?’
* If life is worth living it must be surely for something that is an end in
  itself. Aristotle identifies 3 such things: wisdom, virtue, and pleasure.
* Aristotle distinguishes between a state (hexis) and its use (chresis) or
  exercise (energeia). Virtue and wisdom are both states, where as happiness
  is an activity, and therefore cannot be simply identified with either of
  them. The activity that constitutes happiness is, however, a use or
  exercise of virtue. Wisdom and moral virtue, though different *hexeis*,
  are exercised inseparably in a single *energeia*, so that they are not
  competing but collaborating contributors to happiness. Moreover, pleasure
  is identical with the unimpeded exercise of an appropriate state: so that
  happiness, considered as the unimpeded exercise of these two states, is
  simultaneously the life of virtue, wisdom, and pleasure.

## Aristotle on moral and intellectual virtue

* Virtue is expressed in good purpose, that is to say, a prescription for
  action in accordance with a good plan of life. The actions which express
  moral virtue will avoid excess and defect. However, Aristotle warns us
  that what constitutes the right amount to drink, the right amount to give
  away, the right amount of talking to do, may differ from person to person,
  in the way that the amount of good fit for an Olympic champion may not
  suit a novice athlete.
* Virtue is concerned not only with action but with passion. We may have too
  many fears or too few fears, and courage will enable us to fear when fear
  is appropriate and be fearless when it is not. (MK: now we just need to
  figure out when it is appropriate to be afraid and when it is not.)
* The virtues, besides being concerned with means of action and passion, are
  themselves means in the sense that they occupy a middle round between two
  contrary vices. Thus courage is in the middle, flanked on one side by
  foolhardiness and on the other side by cowardice, etc.
* Not every kind of action is capable of a virtuous mean. There are some
  actions of which there is no right amount, because any amount of them is
  too much (e.g. murder, adultery).
* Moral virtue is a state of character expressed in choice, lying in the
  appropriate mean, determined by the prescription that a wise man would lay
  down.
* Long and boring classification of intellectual virtues follows.

## The hedonism of Epicurus

* For Epicurus, pleasure is the final end of life and the criterion of
  goodness in choice. This is something that needs no argument: we all feel
  it in our bones.
* If pleasure is the greatest good, pain is the greatest evil, and it is
  best to pass a pleasure by if it would lead to long-term suffering.
  Equally, it is worth putting up with pain if it will bring great pleasure
  in the long run.
* A simple vegetarian diet and the company of a few friends in a modest
  garden suffice for Epicurean happiness.
* What enabled Epicurus to combine theoretical hedonism with practical
  asceticism is his understanding of pleasure as being essentially the
  satisfaction of desire. The strongest and most fundamental of our desires
  is the desire for the removal of pain. Hence, the mere absence of pain is
  itself a fundamental pleasure.
* Among our desires some are natural and some are futile (i.e. they do not
  cause pain when unfulfilled) and it is the natural desires to which the
  most important pleasures correspond.
* There are two kinds of pleasure for which Epicurus framed technical terms:
  there is the kinetic pleasure of quenching one's third, and the static
  pleasure that supervenes when one's thirst has been quenched.

## Stoic ethics

* The drive towards the preservation and progress of one's own constitution
  is something more primitive than the desire for pleasure, since it occurs
  in plants as well as animals, and even in humans is often exercised
  without consciousness.
* Zeno: the end of life is ‘to live in agreement with Nature.’
* Each of us, according to Hierocles, stands at the center of a series of
  concentric circles. The first circle surrounding my individual mind
  contains my body and its needs .The second contains my immediate family,
  and the third and fourth contain extensions of my family. Then come
  circles of neighbors, at varying distances, plus the circle that contains
  all my co-nationals. The outermost and largest circle encompasses the
  whole human race. If I am virtuous I will try to draw these circles closer
  together, treating cousins as if they were brothers, and constantly
  transferring people from outer circles to inner circles. The Stoics coined
  a special word for the process thus pcturesquely described: ‘oikeiosis’,
  literally ‘homification’.
* Living in agreement with nature was, for the Stoics, equivalent to living
  according to virtue. Their best-known moral tenet was that virtue alone
  was necessary and sufficient for happiness. Virtue was not only the final
  end and the supreme good: it was also the only real good.
* There are things that are good (in agreement with nature), evil (those are
  against nature), and then there are ‘indifferent matters’.
* Indifferent matters, were not all on the same level as each other. Some
  were popular and others unpopular. Some went with nature and some went
  against nature. Those that went with nature had value and those that went
  against nature had disvalue. It seems clear that, according to the Stoics,
  all things that have value are also popular; it is not clear whether
  everything that is popular also has value.
* The weakness in the Stoic position is its refusal to come to terms with
  the fragility of happiness. We have met a parallel temptation in classical
  epistemology: the refusal to come to terms with the fallibility of
  judgement. The epistemological temptation is embodied in the fallacious
  argument from ‘Necessarily, if I know that p, then p’ to ‘If I know that
  p, then necessarily p’. The parallel temptation in ethics is to argue from
  “Necessarily, if I am happy, I have X” to ‘If I am happy, have X
  necessarily’. This argument, if successful, leads to the denial that
  happiness can be constituted by any contingent good that is capable of
  being lost.
* The wise man has all virtues and he is as rare as phoenix. The Stoics
  purchase the invulnerability of happiness only ta the cost of making it
  unattainable.
* The Stoics' doctrine of wisdom and happiness, then, offers us little
  encouragement to strive for virtue. However, later Stoics made a
  distinction between doctrine and precepts, the one being general and the
  other particular. While the doctrine is austere and Olympian, the
  precepts, by an amiable inconsistency, are often quite liberal and
  practical.

# How to live: ethics

* Thales: ‘If we do not ourselves do what we blame other for doing.’
* Heraclitus: ‘It is not good for men to get all they want.’
* Heraclitus: ‘A man's character is his destiny.’

## Democritus the moralist

* His ideal was a life of cheerfulness and quiet contentment.
* Democritus praised temperance, but was not an ascetic. Thrift and fasting
  were good, but so was banqueting; the difficulty was judging the right
  time for each.
* The cause of sin is ignorance of what is better.
* You are better off be wronged than doing wrong.

## Socrates on virtue

* Socrates started systematic inquiry into the nature of virtue.
* Socrates often compares and contrasts virtues and skills.
  * Arts and sciences are transmitted through teaching by experts, but there
    do not seem to be any experts who can teach virtue.
  * If the going wrong was making a mistake in the exercise of a skill—e.g.
    playing a false note on the flute, or missing the mark in archery—then
    it is better if it was done on purpose: that is to say, a deliberate
    mistake is not a reflection on one's skill. But things seem different
    when the going wrong is a failure in virtue: it is odd to say that
    someone who violates my rights on purpose is less unjust than someone
    who violates them unwittingly.
* Socrates denies that there are people who sin against virtue on purpose.
  If a man goes wrong he does so through ignorance, through lack of
  knowledge of what is best for him. We all wish to do well and be happy: it
  is for this reason that people want things like health, wealth, power, and
  honor. But these things are only good if we know how to use them well; in
  the absence of this knowledge they can do us more harm than good. This
  knowledge of how best to use what one possesses is wisdom (phronesis) and
  it is the only thing that is truly good. Wisdom is the science of what is
  good and what is bad, and it is identical with virtue—with all the
  virtues.
* For example, actions that exhibit courage are of course different action
  from those that exhibit temperance; but what they express is a single,
  indivisible state of soul. If we say that courage is the science of what
  is good and bad in respect of future dangers, we have to agree that such a
  science is only possible as port of an overall science of good and evil.
  The individual virtues are parts of this science, but it can only be
  possessed as a whole. No one, not even Socrates, is in possession of this
  science.
* Knowledge that an action is evil must be knowledge that, taken with its
  consequences, the action will lead to an excess of pain over pleasure. No
  one with such knowledge is going to undertake such an action; hence the
  person acting wrongly must lack the knowledge. MK: Equating pleasure with
  ‘good’ does not stand. What about wrongdoing which one can get away with?
  Socrates certainly was not familiar with Putin—that man knowingly does all
  kinds of terrible things but he is never held accountable.

## Plato on justice and pleasure

* In Republic Socrates sets out an analogy between the soul and the city. In
  his imagined city virtues are allotted to different classes of the state:
  the city's wisdom is the wisdom of its rulers, its courage is the courage
  of its soldiers, and its temperance is the obedience of the artisans to
  the ruling class. Justice is the harmony of the three classes.
* Later, after introduction of Plato's theory of ideas, a different account
  is presented. The just man is happier than the unjust, not only because
  his soul is in concord, but because it is more delightful to fill the soul
  with understanding than to feed fat the desires of appetite. Reason is no
  longer the faculty that takes care of the person, it is akin to the
  unchanging and immortal world of truth.
* Plato returns to the topic of happiness and pleasure in *Philebus*. At the
  end of the discussion Socrates wins his point against Protarchus: on a
  well-considered grading of good even the best of pleasures come out below
  wisdom. The most interesting part of the dialogue, however, is an argument
  to the effect that neither pleasure nor wisdom can be the essence of a
  happy life, but that only a mixed life that has both pleasure and wisdom
  in it would really be worth choosing.

## Aristotle on eudaimonia

* Aristotle asks ‘what is a good life and how it is to be acquired?’
* If life is worth living it must be surely for something that is an end in
  itself. Aristotle identifies 3 such things: wisdom, virtue, and pleasure.
* Aristotle distinguishes between a state (hexis) and its use (chresis) or
  exercise (energeia). Virtue and wisdom are both states, where as happiness
  is an activity, and therefore cannot be simply identified with either of
  them. The activity that constitutes happiness is, however, a use or
  exercise of virtue. Wisdom and moral virtue, though different *hexeis*,
  are exercised inseparably in a single *energeia*, so that they are not
  competing but collaborating contributors to happiness. Moreover, pleasure
  is identical with the unimpeded exercise of an appropriate state: so that
  happiness, considered as the unimpeded exercise of these two states, is
  simultaneously the life of virtue, wisdom, and pleasure.

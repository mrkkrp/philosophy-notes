# God

## Xenopahanes' natural theology

* X. was not impressed with the traditional anthropomorphized deities.
* He believed that there must be one God and it must be completely unlike
  humans.
* His theology was mostly negative, he finds it difficult to accept either
  that God is finite, or that he is infinite. Similarly, when he asks
  whether God is changing or changeless, he finds equally balanced arguments
  on each side.
* X. presents his monotheism not as an oracular revelation, but as the
  result of rational argument.

## Socrates and Plato on piety

* When we pray for something that we want, we may be asking for something
  that will harm us: an answer to pray may be a disaster. Since we lack the
  knowledge of what is best for us, it is better not to ask for anything;
  or, like the Spartans, simply to pray for what is good and noble, without
  specifying further.
* For Plato in his middle period the summit of the world is occupied not by
  a personal God but by the Idea of the Good.
* By the time Plato wrote *Timaeus* he had reached a conception of God close
  to that of the major monotheistic religions.
* God is not conceived by Plato as the creator of the universe out of
  nothing; rather, he established the cosmos by bringing order out of chaos.
* In the ideal city of Magnesia atheism is prohibited under severe
  penalties.

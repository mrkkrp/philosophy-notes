# God

## Xenopahanes' natural theology

* X. was not impressed with the traditional anthropomorphized deities.
* He believed that there must be one God and it must be completely unlike
  humans.
* His theology was mostly negative, he finds it difficult to accept either
  that God is finite, or that he is infinite. Similarly, when he asks
  whether God is changing or changeless, he finds equally balanced arguments
  on each side.
* X. presents his monotheism not as an oracular revelation, but as the
  result of rational argument.

## Socrates and Plato on piety

* When we pray for something that we want, we may be asking for something
  that will harm us: an answer to pray may be a disaster. Since we lack the
  knowledge of what is best for us, it is better not to ask for anything;
  or, like the Spartans, simply to pray for what is good and noble, without
  specifying further.
* For Plato in his middle period the summit of the world is occupied not by
  a personal God but by the Idea of the Good.
* By the time Plato wrote *Timaeus* he had reached a conception of God close
  to that of the major monotheistic religions.
* God is not conceived by Plato as the creator of the universe out of
  nothing; rather, he established the cosmos by bringing order out of chaos.
* In the ideal city of Magnesia atheism is prohibited under severe
  penalties.

## Aristotle's unmoved movers

* Everything in motion is moved by something else.
* Aristotle rejects the possibility of self-movers through a very murky
  argument that is also only very vaguely explained in the book. No need to
  repeat it here.
* Many fallacies in Aristotle's thinking.
* Not clear how Aristotle deals with self-moving animals and humans.
* Not clear why Aristotle does not consider seriously the case of infinite
  regress in the casual chain of movers, especially that he was a proponent
  of the idea of the eternal universe.
* The question of what God must be thinking of is quite hilarious.

## The gods of Epicurus and the Stoics

* For Epicurus gods live in imperishable bliss and anything that is
  incompatible with that state should not be accepted as truth about Gods.
* To Epicurus the world does not look like it was made for the benefit of
  humans.
* Epicurus accepted the existence of gods because of the consensus of the
  human race: a belief so widespread and so basic must be implanted by
  nature and therefore be true.
* The controlling thought of Stoic theology is the identification of God
  with providence, that is to say, the rationality of natural processes.
* On one hand, the doctrine of divine providence played an important part in
  the Stoic system, and providence may seem incompatible with the existence
  of evil. On the other hand, since for the Stoics vice is the only real
  evil, the problem seems more restricted in scope for them than it does for
  theists of other schools. Chrysippus found a solution by appealing to a
  principle that contraries can exist only in coexistence with each other:
  justice with injustice, courage with cowardice, temperance with
  intemperance, and wisdom with folly. The principle seems faulty: no doubpt
  the concept of an individual virtue may be inseparable from the concept of
  the corresponding vice, but that does not show that both of the concepts
  must be instantiated.

# Historical overview

## Thales of Miletus (c.625-545 BC)

* All things are full of gods.
* Water is the first principle of everything.
* Earth rests on water.

## Anaximander of Miletus (d. c.547 BC)

* Earth is cylindrical in shape, surrounded by tires of fire.
* Earth stays where it is because it is equidistant from everything else and
  there is no reason why it should move in any direction rather than any
  other.
* It is error to identify the ultimate material of the universe with any of
  the elements we can see around us in the contemporary world, such as water
  or file. The fundamental principle of things must be boundless or
  undefined (*aperion*).
* A. saw the world as a field of competing opposites, their interchange is
  governed by a principle of reciprocity.

## Anaximenes (fl. 546-525 BC)

* Earth rests on air.
* Earth is flat.
* Air is the fundamental element. It is divine and generates deities, it is
  our soul and holds our bodies together.

## Pythagoras (b. 570 BC)

* Mathematics is the key to understanding the structure and the order of the
  universe.
* Founded a semi-religious community in Croton that followed a set of
  ascetic and ceremonial rules.

## Xenophanes of Colophon (c.570-c.470 BC)

* The basic element is earth and it reaches down below us to infinity.
* Since the earth reaches down to infinity, the sun is new every day.
* His cosmology is notable for its naturalism. It is free from animist and
  semi-religious elements.

## Heraclitus (fl. c. 500 BC)

* The doctrine of universal flux: everything is in motion and nothing stays
  still. If we step into the same river twice we cannot put our feet twice
  into the same water. Further, we cannot even step twice in the same river.
* Hidden harmony is better than manifest harmony.
* The world is an ever-living fire. Human soul is also fire.
* The world is not made by Gods or men, but governed by Logos (word/reason).
* Insistence on coincidence of opposites:
  * The universe is both divisible and indivisible, generated and
    ungenerated, mortal and immortal.
  * The way up and the way down are one and the same.

## Parmenides (c. late 6th century BC)

* Nothing is in motion, nothing changes.
* Whatever changes there might be, they are not changes from being to
  non-being. They are all changes within Being. Being is everlastingly the
  same and time is unreal because past, present, and future are all one.
* The first to speak of metaphysics.
* Earth is a sphere.

## Melissus (fl. c. 500 BC)

* Pupil of Parmenides.
* The universe is unlimited, unchangeable, immovable, indivisible, and
  homogeneous.
* Pain is unreal because it implies (impossibly) a deficiency of being.
* There is no such thing as vacuum since it would have to be a piece of
  Unbeing. Local motion is therefore impossible, for the bodies that occupy
  space have no room to move into.

## Zeno of Elea (c. 490 – c. 430 BC)

* Another pupil of Parmenides.
* Zeno's paradoxes.

## Empedocles (c. 494 – c. 434 BC, fl. 444–443 BC)

* All four elements (earth, water, air, fire) are fundamental “roots” of
  matter.
* A cosmological theory must not just identify the elements of the universe,
  but must assign causes for the development and intermingling of the
  elements to make the living and inanimate compounds of the actual world.
  E. assigns these roles to Love and Strife. Love combines the elements,
  Strife forces them apart.
* Evolution of survival of the fittest. First flesh and bone emerged as
  chemical mixtures of the elements, then out of these constituents limbs
  and organs emerged: unsocketed eyes, arms without shoulders, and faces
  without necks. These roamed around until they chanced to find partners;
  they formed unions, which were often, at this preliminary stage, quite
  unsuitable. Thus there arose various monstrosities: human-headed oxen,
  ox-headed humans, androgynous creatures with faces and breasts on front
  and back. Most of these fortuitous organisms were fragile and sterile;
  only the fittest structures survived to be the human and animal species we
  know.

## Anaxagoras (c. 500 – c. 428 BC)

* Account of the beginning of the universe : “All things were together,
  infinite in number and infinite in smallness; for the small too was
  infinite. While all things were together, nothing was recognizable because
  of its smallness. Everything lay under air and ether, both infinite.” This
  primeval pebble began to rotate, throwing off the surrounding ether and
  air and forming out of them the stars and the sun and the moon. The
  rotation caused the of dense from rare, of hot from cold, of dry from wet,
  and bright from dark. But the separation was never complete, and to this
  day there remains in every single thing a portion of everything else (a
  little whiteness in black, etc.).
* The idea of multiverse.
* All things were together: then Mind came and gave them order. Mind is
  infinite and separate, and has no part in the general commingling of
  elements; if it did, it would get drawn into the evolutionary process and
  could not control it.
* The first writers to include diagrams in his text.

## Democritus (c. 460 – c. 370 BC)

* Matter is not infinitely divisible. The tiniest parts of matter are called
  atoms (indivisible). I found the argument for this (the version of
  Aristotle) unconvincing, since it assumes that the process of infinite
  division can happen in finite time and we can then make some final
  examination of the result.
* Atoms are in constant movement in vacuum. They differ in shape, in order,
  in posture. Some of them are concave and some convex, some are like hooks,
  some are like eyes. In their ceaseless motion they bang into each other
  and join up with each other.
* D. was a believer in plural worlds.

## Socrates (c. 470–399 BC)

* Inductive arguments.
* Search for general definitions in various Platonic dialogues.
* Virtue and moral knowledge are the same thing. No one who really knows
  what is the best thing to do can do otherwise, and all wrongdoing is the
  result of ignorance.
* Socrates' method does not claim that we cannot ever know whether some
  particular action is or is not, say, pious unless we can give a watertight
  definition of piety. Socrates' method involves only the weaker claim that
  unless we have a general definition of a virtue we will not
  * be able to say whether the virtue universally has a particular
  property, such as being teachable, or being beneficial, or
  * be able to decide difficult borderline cases.
* The inductive argument from particular instances to general truths is a
  contribution to the universal definition, even though the contribution in
  the dialogues is forever incomplete, never leading to an exception-proof
  definition.

## Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348 BC)

* The theory of ideas.
* The thesis of recollection (ideas are acquired in a previous life).
* For each thing there is three things are necessary if we are to come by
  knowledge: first, the name, secondly, the definition, and thirdly, the
  image. Knowledge itself is a fourth thing, and there is a fifth thing that
  we have to postulate, which is that which is knowable and truly real (the
  idea). The idea is an objective reality that is not the property of any
  individual mind.
* Republic—a dialogue outlining the ideal organization (according to Plato)
  of a city-state. Three classes: guardians (soldiers best fitted to rule),
  auxiliaries (other soldiers), farmers and artisans. Women are to be held
  in common and all sexual intercourse is to be public.
* There are 5 possible types of political constitution. The first and best
  constitution is monarchy or aristocracy: if wisdom rules it does not
  matter whether is it incarnate in one or many rules. There are 4 inferior
  types of constitution: timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and despotism.
  Each of these constitutions declines into the next because of the
  downgrading of one of the virtues of the ideal state. If the rules cease
  to be persons of wisdom, aristocracy gives place to timocracy, which is
  essentially rule by a milliary junta. Oligarchy differs from timocracy
  because oligarchic rules lack fortitude and military virtues. Oligarchs do
  possess, in a rather miserly form, the virtue of temperance; when this is
  abandoned oligarchy gives way to democracy. For Plato any step away from
  aristocracy of the ideal republic is a step away from justice; but it is
  the step from democracy to despotism that marks the enthronement of
  injustice incarnate.
* In *Laws* Plato makes up yet another perfect state Magnesia, to be founded
  in the south of Crete.
* Proponent of the idea that our universe is the only one. World is made of
  4 elements as usual, accepted the atomist theory of Democritus.
* Wrote in the form of dialogues.

## Aristotle (384–322 BCE)

* Founded logic as a discipline.
* Criticism of Plato's theory of ideas: “The theory does not confer
  intelligibility on particulars, because immutable and everlasting forms
  cannot explain how particulars come into existence and undergo change.
  Moreover, they do not contribute anything either to the knowledge or to
  the being of other things. All the theory does is to bring in new entities
  equal in number to the entities to be explained: as if one could solve a
  problem by doubling it.”
* Significant contributions to biology, particularly in zoology and marine
  biology. His detailed observations of organisms were without precedent and
  in many cases they were not superseded until the seventeenth century.
* Wrote in prose monologue.
* There are three kinds of sciences: productive, practical, and theoretical.
  Productive sciences are sciences that have a product. They include
  engineering and architecture, with products like bridges and houses, but
  also disciplines such as strategy and rhetoric, where the product is
  something less concrete, such as victory on the battlefield or in the
  courts. Practical sciences are ones that guide behavior, most notable
  ethics and politics. Theoretical sciences are those that have no product
  and no practical goal, but in which information and understanding is
  sought for its own sake.
* An idea of state with division of power in 3 branches: the deliberative,
  the official, and the judicial.
* Less impressive contributions to chemistry and physics than to biology.
* The four causes: material, formal, efficient, and final. When Alfredo
  cooks a risotto, the material causes of the risotto are the ingredients
  that go into it, the efficient cause is the chef himself, the recipe is
  the formal cause, and the satisfaction of the clients of his restaurant is
  the final cause.

## Epicurus (341–270 BC)

* The aim of E. philosophy is to make happiness possible by removing the
  fear of death, which is the greatest obstacle to tranquillity.
* The terrors held out by religion are fairy tales, which we must give up in
  favor of a scientific account of the world.
* Followed Democritus' atomism.
* Proponent of the theory of an infinite number of worlds.
* Like everything else the soul consists of atoms.
* Gods exist, but we are masters of our own fate: the gods neither impose
  necessity nor interfere with our choices.
* Senses are reliable sources of information. Sense-impressions are never,
  in themselves, false, though we may make false judgments on the basis of
  genuine appearances.
* Pleasure is the beginning and the end of the happy life. This does not
  mean, however, that E. was an epicure. His life and that of his followers
  was far from luxurious: a good piece of cheese, he said, was as good as a
  feast.
* Satisfaction of the desires for food, drink, and sex is itself painful and
  leads to a renewal of desire. The pleasures to be aimed at are quiet
  pleasures such as those of private friendship.

## Stoicism

* Founded by Zeno of Citium (344-262 BC).
* God is not separate from the universe but is a material constituent of the
  cosmos (pantheism).
* Stoic physical system can be summarized as follows. Once upon a time,
  there was nothing but fire; gradually there emerged the other elements and
  the familiar furniture of the universe. Later, the world will return to
  fire in a universal conflagration, and then the whole cycle of its history
  will be repeated over and over again. All this happens in accordance with
  a system of laws which may be called ‘fate’ (because the laws admit of no
  exception), or ‘providence’ (because the laws were laid down by God for
  beneficent purposes). The divinely designed system is called Nature, and
  our aim in life should be to live in accord with Nature.
* A problem: if everything is fated, then how could we not live in accord
  with Nature? Apparently, despite the determinism of fate human beings are
  free and responsible. If the will obeys reason it will live in accordance
  with Nature. It is this voluntary acceptance of Nature's laws that
  constitutes virtue, and virtue is both necessary and sufficient for
  happiness. This leaves a big question about what exactly these “laws of
  Nature” mean when applied to human society. It seems like Stoics accepted
  that society is natural to human beings, but that's a very general thing
  to claim. Indeed, it looks like Chrysippus allegedly defended incest and
  cannibalism.
* For a Stoic it was acceptable, indeed praiseworthy, to take part in public
  life.

## Skepticism in the Academy

* Arcesilaus (316/5–241/0 BC) is the founder of Academic skepticism.
* He and Timon denied the possibility of finding any self-evident principles
  to serve as the foundation of sciences. In the absence of such axioms, all
  lines of reasoning must be circular or endless.

## Seneca (4 BC–AD 65)

* Urges us to strive towards liberation from passions.
* None of those things that strike the mind fortuitously should be called
  passions: they are not things that mind causes but things that happen to
  it. It is not passion to be affected by the appearances of things that
  present themselves; passion consists in surrendering oneself to them and
  following up this fortuitous impact. Weeping, turning pale, sudden intakes
  of breath, and sexual arousal are not passions, but mere bodily phenomena:
  it is what happens in the mind that matters.
* S. was a materialist accepting the Stoic doctrine that the human mind was
  a material part of a material divine world-soul.
* S. made popular the distinction between doctrines and precepts. The
  doctrines provided the general philosophical framework; the precepts
  enabled the true concept of the highest good to find expression in
  specific prescriptions to individuals. This distinction enabled Stoics to
  counter the allegation that their system was too elevated to be of any
  practical use.

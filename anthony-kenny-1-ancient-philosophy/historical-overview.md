# Historical overview

## Thales of Miletus (c.625-545 BC)

* All things are full of gods.
* Water is the first principle of everything.
* Earth rests on water.

## Anaximander of Miletus (d. c.547 BC)

* Earth is cylindrical in shape, surrounded by tires of fire.
* Earth stays where it is because it is equidistant from everything else and
  there is no reason why it should move in any direction rather than any
  other.
* It is error to identify the ultimate material of the universe with any of
  the elements we can see around us in the contemporary world, such as water
  or file. The fundamental principle of things must be boundless or
  undefined (*aperion*).
* A. saw the world as a field of competing opposites, their interchange is
  governed by a principle of reciprocity.

## Anaximenes (fl. 546-525 BC)

* Earth rests on air.
* Earth is flat.
* Air is the fundamental element. It is divine and generates deities, it is
  our soul and holds our bodies together.

## Pythagoras (b. 570 BC)

* Mathematics is the key to understanding the structure and the order of the
  universe.
* Founded a semi-religious community in Croton that followed a set of
  ascetic and ceremonial rules.

## Xenophanes of Colophon (c.570-c.470 BC)

* The basic element is earth and it reaches down below us to infinity.
* Since the earth reaches down to infinity, the sun is new every day.
* His cosmology is notable for its naturalism. It is free from animist and
  semi-religious elements.

## Heraclitus (fl. c. 500 BC)

* The doctrine of universal flux: everything is in motion and nothing stays
  still. If we step into the same river twice we cannot put our feet twice
  into the same water. Further, we cannot even step twice in the same river.
* Hidden harmony is better than manifest harmony.
* The world is an ever-living fire. Human soul is also fire.
* The world is not made by Gods or men, but governed by Logos (word/reason).
* Insistence on coincidence of opposites:
  * The universe is both divisible and indivisible, generated and
    ungenerated, mortal and immortal.
  * The way up and the way down are one and the same.

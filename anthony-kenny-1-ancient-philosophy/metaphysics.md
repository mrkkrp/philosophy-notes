# What there is: metaphysics

Metaphysics is the study of Being. Being (with a capital B) is all that is.

## Parmenides' ontology

* For Parmenides, Being is not just that which exists, but that of which any
  sentence containing ‘is’ is true. Equally, being is not just existing but
  being anything whatever: being hot or being cold, being earth or being
  water, and so on. Thus interpreted, Being is a realm both richer and more
  puzzling than the totality of existents.
* Being for Parmenides seems to be anything that is potentially reachable by
  thought, anything of which something can be predicated.
* Unbeing is something that cannot be reached by thought and of which
  nothing can be predicated.
* Change is never from non-being to being, vice versa; the most there can
  ever be is variation of being.
* Being is undivided and unlimited. (What could separate Being from Being?
  Being? In that case there is no division, only continuous Being. Unbeing?
  In that case the division is unreal. Etc.)
* Somehow Parmenides arrives at the conclusion that the universe is a
  perfect sphere. That is gratuitous and does not follow from his earlier
  points.
* Apparent changes in the world belong to the way of seeming. If we want
  to follow the way of truth, we must keep our minds fixed on Being.

## Plato's ideas and their troubles

* Being, the sum of all, is both at once—all that in unchangeable (influence
  of Parmenides, this takes the form of the Theory of Ideas) and all that is
  in change (influence of Heraclitus, the perceptible universe of the
  senses).
* The realm of Ideas, while unchanging, is not uniform or homogeneous like
  Parmenides' Being. Being is undifferentiated and single whereas there are
  many different Ideas in some kind of relation to each other. They appear
  to be hierarchically ordered, under the Idea of Good, which appears to
  trump any notion of Being. Other Ideas owe it to the Idea of Good that
  they are Ideas at all: a bed is a Perfect or Ideal Bed because it
  participates in Perfection and is the best possible bed. But the relations
  between the different subordinate Ideas are not at all spelled out.
* The six principles of the classical Theory of Ideas:
  1. *The principle of commonality*. Whether several things are F, this is
     because they participate in or imitate a single Idea of F.
  2. *The principle of Separation*. The Idea of F is distinct from all the
     things that are F.
  3. *The principle of self-predication.* The Idea of F is itself F.
  4. *The principle of purity.* The Idea of F is nothing but F.
  5. *The principle of uniqueness.* Nothing but the Idea of F is really,
     truly, altogether F.
  6. *The principle of sublimity.* Ideas are everlasting, they have no parts
     and undergo no change, and they are not perceptible to the senses.
* The problems set out in the first part of *Parmenides*:
  1. According to the theory, particular Fs are F because they participate
     in the Idea of F. But what does ‘participation’ mean? Does a particular
     F share only a part of the Idea, or does it contain the whole of the
     Idea? (MK: this is really a strange question to ask, why take the
     notion of participation so literally?) There are difficulties either
     way. If a particular large thing L has the whole Idea of Large, then
     the Idea seems to be scattered and lack the unity of an Idea; but if L
     shares only a part of the Large, then it is large by something which is
     itself small, because being only a part of it must be smaller than the
     Large.
  2. It is essential to the theory that wherever several things are F they
     derive this from some other entity which is the Idea of F. Thus, the
     several large things derive their largeness from the Idea of Large. But
     if we put together the original set of large things plus the Idea, we
     have a new set of large things, which must derive their largeness from
     some other entity. ‘So another form of largeness will appear, alongside
     the Idea of Large and the things that participated in it, and then
     another again over all these’—so that we are set off on an infinite
     regress. This line of thought much impressed Aristotle, who,
     substituting ‘man’ instead of ‘large’ for F in the original premise,
     named it the Third Man argument, after the Man who would appear as a
     Super-idea, after (a) the men in the world and (b) the Ideal Man.
  3. There is a special difficulty with relational predicates. Suppose I am
     a slave. According to the theory, that must be because I resemble the
     Ideal Slave. But who is the Ideal Slave's owner? Surely, the Ideal
     Owner. But I am not a slave of the Ideal Owner but of whoever is my
     terrestrial slave-owner. So the relationship between entities in the
     world cannot be explained by relationships between the Ideas. MK: well,
     that's not true: there is a parallel in relationships, I am to my owner
     what the Ideal Owner is to the Ideal Slave.
* In *Parmenides*, Plato abandons the principles of purity and uniqueness.
  MK: my understanding is that the principle of purity must be false because
  if F is only F, then nothing else can be said about it (except that it is
  F) and so we can have no knowledge about it. Kenny does not give an
  understandable explanation why uniqueness would not hold. Logically, it
  must be again because for any F it is only the Idea of F is F, then we
  cannot say that some other idea or thing is F (?) By attaching every
  predicate only to its respective Idea we have depleted our vocabulary and
  ability to talk about anything. Not sure whether this is what Kenny means
  in his exegesis.
* Predication *per se* and *per accidens*:
  * S is P per se if being P is part of what it is to be S. Thus an oak is a
    tree per se.
  * S is P per accidens if S is as a matter of fact P, but it is no part of
    being S to be P.
* Plato updates the principle of self-predication. Now the Idea of F is F
  per se, while everything else is F per accidens.
* Relations in the realm of Ideas are per se, while in our world they are
  only per accidens.

# What there is: metaphysics

Metaphysics is the study of Being. Being (with a capital B) is all that is.

## Parmenides' ontology

* For Parmenides, Being is not just that which exists, but that of which any
  sentence containing ‘is’ is true. Equally, being is not just existing but
  being anything whatever: being hot or being cold, being earth or being
  water, and so on. Thus interpreted, Being is a realm both richer and more
  puzzling than the totality of existents.
* Being for Parmenides seems to be anything that is potentially reachable by
  thought, anything of which something can be predicated.
* Unbeing is something that cannot be reached by thought and of which
  nothing can be predicated.
* Change is never from non-being to being, vice versa; the most there can
  ever be is variation of being.
* Being is undivided and unlimited. (What could separate Being from Being?
  Being? In that case there is no division, only continuous Being. Unbeing?
  In that case the division is unreal. Etc.)
* Somehow Parmenides arrives at the conclusion that the universe is a
  perfect sphere. That is gratuitous and does not follow from his earlier
  points.
* Apparent changes in the world belong to the way of seeming. If we want
  to follow the way of truth, we must keep our minds fixed on Being.

# How things happen: physics

## The continuum

* There are 3 types of relationship between quantified items: they may be
  successive, adjacent, or continuous.
* Two items are successive if between them there is nothing of the same kind
  as themselves.
* Two items are adjacent if they have two boundaries in contact with each
  other. MK: what does it mean exactly for the boundaries to be in contact
  with each other and yet not coincide, since if they coincide then they are
  continuous, see below.
* Two items are continuous if there is only single common boundary between
  them. MK: what is the nature of this boundary?
* MK: surely there are also items that are not in any of these 3
  relationships between each other, e.g. the natural numbers 5 and 7.
* Aristotle uses these (already flawed) definitions to base an argument that
  a continuum cannot be composed of indivisible atoms.
* Position of Democritus: if matter is divisible to infinity, then let us
  suppose that this division has been carried out. How large are the
  fragments resulting from this division? If they have any magnitude at all,
  then, on the hypothesis of infinite divisibility, it would be possible to
  divide them further; so they must be fragments with no extension, like a
  geometrical point. But whatever can be divided can be put together again,
  yet if our fragments have no magnitude, then how can they ever have added
  up to make the extended chunk of matter with which we began? So we have to
  conclude that divisibility comes to an end, and the smallest possible
  fragments must be bodies with sizes and shapes.
* Aristotle sets out to answer this difficulty. ‘Divisible to infinity’,
  means ‘unendingly divisible’, not ‘divisible into infinitely many parts’.
  (MK: another way of saying that one cannot observe the result of infinite
  division, since it would take an infinite number of steps.) However often
  a magnitude has been divided, it can always be divided further. The
  continuum does not have an infinite number of parts; indeed Aristotle
  regarded the idea of an actually infinite number as incoherent. The
  infinite, he says, has only a potential existence.
* There is a difference between saying that wherever is continuous can be
  divided at *any* point (Aristotle's position) and saying that whatever is
  continuous can be divided at *every* point (Democritus' supposition).
* MK: does it even make sense that 2 items are continuous? Surely it is not
  the items but the magnitude between them that is continuous.

## Aristotle on place

* Place cannot be identified with the body that occupies it. What is it,
  then?
* The universe is not anywhere; for whatever is somewhere must not only
  exist itself, but also have something alongside it in which it is and
  which contains it. But there is nothing outside the entire universe.
* Is it clear that place as described by Aristotle is quite different from
  space as often conceived since Newton as an infinite extension or cosmic
  grid. Newtonian space would exist whether or not the material universe had
  been created. For Aristotle, if there were no bodies there would be no
  place; there can, however, be a vacuum, a place empty of bodies, but only
  if the place is bounded by actual bodies. His concept of place, therefore,
  can avoid the difficulties that have led philosophers such as Kant to deny
  the reality of space.

## Aristotle on motion

* ‘Motion’ for Aristotle is a broad term, including changes in several
  different categories, such as growth in size or change in color.
* Motion is the actuality of what is in potentiality, in so far as it is in
  potentiality. Motion is a notion difficult to grasp, and this is because
  it is as it were halfway between straight potentiality and straight
  actuality.
* Motion is a continuum: a mere series of positions between A and B is not a
  motion from A to B. At any point at which X is moving, there will be an
  earlier point at which it was already moving. It follows that there is no
  such thing as a first instant of motion.

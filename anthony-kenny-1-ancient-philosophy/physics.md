# How things happen: physics

## The continuum

* There are 3 types of relationship between quantified items: they may be
  successive, adjacent, or continuous.
* Two items are successive if between them there is nothing of the same kind
  as themselves.
* Two items are adjacent if they have two boundaries in contact with each
  other. MK: what does it mean exactly for the boundaries to be in contact
  with each other and yet not coincide, since if they coincide then they are
  continuous, see below.
* Two items are continuous if there is only single common boundary between
  them. MK: what is the nature of this boundary?
* MK: surely there are also items that are not in any of these 3
  relationships between each other, e.g. the natural numbers 5 and 7.
* Aristotle uses these (already flawed) definitions to base an argument that
  a continuum cannot be composed of indivisible atoms.
* Position of Democritus: if matter is divisible to infinity, then let us
  suppose that this division has been carried out. How large are the
  fragments resulting from this division? If they have any magnitude at all,
  then, on the hypothesis of infinite divisibility, it would be possible to
  divide them further; so they must be fragments with no extension, like a
  geometrical point. But whatever can be divided can be put together again,
  yet if our fragments have no magnitude, then how can they ever have added
  up to make the extended chunk of matter with which we began? So we have to
  conclude that divisibility comes to an end, and the smallest possible
  fragments must be bodies with sizes and shapes.
* Aristotle sets out to answer this difficulty. ‘Divisible to infinity’,
  means ‘unendingly divisible’, not ‘divisible into infinitely many parts’.
  (MK: another way of saying that one cannot observe the result of infinite
  division, since it would take an infinite number of steps.) However often
  a magnitude has been divided, it can always be divided further. The
  continuum does not have an infinite number of parts; indeed Aristotle
  regarded the idea of an actually infinite number as incoherent. The
  infinite, he says, has only a potential existence.
* There is a difference between saying that wherever is continuous can be
  divided at *any* point (Aristotle's position) and saying that whatever is
  continuous can be divided at *every* point (Democritus' supposition).
* MK: does it even make sense that 2 items are continuous? Surely it is not
  the items but the magnitude between them that is continuous.

## Aristotle on place

* Place cannot be identified with the body that occupies it. What is it,
  then?
* The universe is not anywhere; for whatever is somewhere must not only
  exist itself, but also have something alongside it in which it is and
  which contains it. But there is nothing outside the entire universe.
* Is it clear that place as described by Aristotle is quite different from
  space as often conceived since Newton as an infinite extension or cosmic
  grid. Newtonian space would exist whether or not the material universe had
  been created. For Aristotle, if there were no bodies there would be no
  place; there can, however, be a vacuum, a place empty of bodies, but only
  if the place is bounded by actual bodies. His concept of place, therefore,
  can avoid the difficulties that have led philosophers such as Kant to deny
  the reality of space.

## Aristotle on motion

* ‘Motion’ for Aristotle is a broad term, including changes in several
  different categories, such as growth in size or change in color.
* Motion is the actuality of what is in potentiality, in so far as it is in
  potentiality. Motion is a notion difficult to grasp, and this is because
  it is as it were halfway between straight potentiality and straight
  actuality.
* Motion is a continuum: a mere series of positions between A and B is not a
  motion from A to B. At any point at which X is moving, there will be an
  earlier point at which it was already moving. It follows that there is no
  such thing as a first instant of motion.

## Aristotle on time

* Motion acquires its continuity from the continuum of spatial extension.
  Time, in its turn, derives its continuity from the continuity of motion.
* Time is the number of motion in respect of before and after.
* Where there is no motion there is no time. (MK: love this, this is very
  deep and indeed compatible with the modern theories of relativity.)
* It is the *before* and *after* in motion that provides the *earlier* and
  *later* in time.
* We say ‘earlier’ and ‘later’ with reference to distance from the now; and
  the now is the boundary between the past and the future. But ‘earlier’ is
  used in the opposite ways in respect to past time and future time: in the
  past we call earlier that which is further from the now, and later that
  which in nearer to the now; in the future we call earlier that which in
  nearer to the now, and later that which is further away.
* Aristotle uses ‘now’ in two ways: to indicate the present time, and as a
  synonym for ‘instant’ or ‘moment’. In the above passage he appears to be
  amalgamating the two uses to mean ‘the present instant’. This is
  unfortunate because *the present instant* is an incoherent notion.
  ‘Present’ is an adjective applicable only to periods, such as the present
  year or the present century. Instants are the boundaries of periods, and
  future periods are bounded by future instants, and past intervals by past
  instants. But present periods are bounded not by present instants, but by
  two instants, one of which is past and the other future. There is no
  instantaneous present.
* ‘There can be no motion at an instant.’ If now is an instant and there is
  no motion at an instant, then nothing is in motion now. Thus, motion must
  be forever unreal. Truth that lies behind Aristotle's claim is that we can
  only talk of X moving at time t if t is a moment within a period of time,
  t' to t'', during which X is in movement.

## Aristotle on causation and change

* The four causes: material, formal, efficient, and final. When Alfredo
  cooks a risotto, the material causes of the risotto are the ingredients
  that go into it, the efficient cause is the chef himself, the recipe is
  the formal cause, and the satisfaction of the clients of his restaurant is
  the final cause.
* We have a case of alteration when the subject of change is perceptible and
  persists, and merely change its properties… A body, for instance, while
  remaining the same body, is now healthy and now ill; some bronze may be
  now circular and now angular, and yet the same bronze. But when nothing
  perceptible persists in its identity as a subject of change, and the thing
  changes as a whole (when e.g. semen becomes blood, or water changes into
  air, or air totally into water), such an occurrence is a case of one
  substance coming to be and another substance ceasing to be… Matter, in the
  most proper sense of the term, is to be identified with the underlying
  subject which is receptive of coming-to-be and passing away.
* ‘By matter I mean what in itself is neither of any kind nor of any size
  nor describable by any of the categories of being. For it is something of
  which all these things are predicated, and therefore its essence is
  different from that of all the predicates. All the other categories are
  predicated of substance, but substance of matter. Therefore the ultimate
  subject itself is of itself neither of any kind or any size nor anything
  else.’
* Aristotle's ultimate/prime matter is not in and of itself of any kind. It
  is not in and of itself any particular size, because it can grow or
  shrink; it is not in and of itself water, and it is not in and of itself
  steam, because it is each of these in turn. This does not mean that there
  is any time at which it is not of any size, or any time in which it is
  neither water nor steam nor anything else.

## The Stoics on causality

* The Stoics say that every cause is a body (A) that becomes for another
  body (B) a cause of something non-bodily (F). For instance a scalpel,
  which is a body, becomes for the flesh, another body, a cause of the
  non-bodily predicate *being cut*.
* The Stoics used the term ‘matter’ specifically to refer to B, the passive
  element in causation. So in Stoic causation we have a triad of cause,
  matter, and effect.
* The Stoics introduced the notions of joint causes and auxiliary causes.
  This was important, because it shows that it can often be misleading to
  speak of *the* cause of a particular state or event. Causes form not a
  chain, but a network.
* There are also sustaining causes that bring it about that things continue
  in existence. Bodies of all kinds, for instance, are held together by an
  active and tenuous fluid called *pneuma*, literally ‘breath’, which is
  responsible for the cohesion of the universe. Living bodies are kept
  together alive by the soul, which is their sustaining cause. It is
  characteristic of such causes that if they cease to operate, their effects
  cease to obtain.
* Zeno, indeed, stated this characteristic as a feature of all causes, but
  other Stoics seem to have allowed another category of antecedent causes,
  whose effect remained after they had been removed. An antecedent cause
  brings it about that an object possesses an internal feature that is
  itself a sustaining cause simultaneous with the effect to be explained.
  For example, when a patient catches a chill, the coldness of the air is an
  antecedent cause, and the patient's fever is the internal and enduring
  state that is the sustaining cause of his symptoms.

## Causation and determinism

* The Stoics believed in universal causation and universal casual
  determinism, that is to say, that everything has a cause by which it was
  determined.
* Every cause is a necessitating cause: given the cause, the effect cannot
  but happen.
* The inescapable series of necessitating causes was called by Stoics and
  their critics Fate.
* Lazy argument: if determinism is true, there is no point in doing
  whatever. MK: of course this argument is too simplistic: everyone is
  caused to do what they do by the sum of the external stimuli they were
  subjected to up to the moment of the action. Even if someone decided to do
  nothing because they wanted to prove that the lazy argument is true, they
  would be caused to do so by exposition to the idea of determinism and the
  lazy argument itself, plus their own character.

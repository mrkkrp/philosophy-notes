# Soul and mind

## Pythagoras' metempsychosis

* Pythagoras belived in transmigration of souls after death.
* Pythagoras took memory as a criterion of personal identity.

## The anatomy of soul

* The phenomena of mental conflict in Plato's republic: a man may be thirsty
  and yet unwilling to drink (perhaps because of doctor's orders): this
  shows that there is one part of the soul that reflects and a different one
  that feels bodily desires. The first can be called *reason* and the second
  *appetite*. Since anger is in conflict with both reason and appetite, we
  have to attribute it to a third element in the soul, which we can call
  temper. Justice in the soul is the harmony of these three elements.

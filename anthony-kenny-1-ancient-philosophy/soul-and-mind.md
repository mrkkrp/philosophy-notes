# Soul and mind

## Pythagoras' metempsychosis

* Pythagoras belived in transmigration of souls after death.
* Pythagoras took memory as a criterion of personal identity.

## The anatomy of soul

* The phenomena of mental conflict in Plato's republic: a man may be thirsty
  and yet unwilling to drink (perhaps because of doctor's orders): this
  shows that there is one part of the soul that reflects and a different one
  that feels bodily desires. The first can be called *reason* and the second
  *appetite*. Since anger is in conflict with both reason and appetite, we
  have to attribute it to a third element in the soul, which we can call
  temper. Justice in the soul is the harmony of these three elements.

## Aristotle's philosophical psychology

* For Aristotle, a soul is the actuality of a body that has life.
* Soul is the form of a natural, organic body.
* Aristotle's theoretical concept of soul differs from that of Plato before
  him and Descartes after him. A soul, for him, is not an interior,
  immaterial agent acting on a body. ‘We should not ask whether body and
  soul are one thing, any more than we should ask that question about the
  wax and the seal imprinted on it, or about the matter of anything and that
  of which it is the matter.’
* A sense-faculty in operation is identical with a sense-object in action:
  the actuality of the sense-object is one and the same as the actuality of
  the sense-faculty. The sweetness of a cup of tea is a sense-object,
  something that can be tasted. My ability to taste is a sense-faculty. The
  operation of the sense of taste upon the object of taste is the same thing
  as the action of the object upon my sense. That is to say, the tea's
  tasting sweet to me is one and the same event as my tasting the sweetness
  of the tea.
* The tea is actually sweet, whereas before the sugar was put in, it was
  only potentially sweet. The sweetness of the tea in the cup is a first
  actuality: the tea's actually tasting sweet to me is a second actuality.
  Sweetness is nothing other than the power to taste sweet to suitable
  tasters; and the faculty of taste is nothing other than the power to taste
  such things as the sweetness of sweet objects. Thus we can agree that the
  sensible property in operation is the same thing as the faculty in
  operation, though of course the power to taste and the power to be tasted
  are two different things, one in an animal and the other in a substance.
* The object we encounter in experience are only potentially, not actually,
  thinkable, just as colors in the dark are only potentially, not actually,
  visible. The active intellect creates concepts—actually thinkable
  objects—by abstracting universal forms from particular experience. These
  matterless forms exist only in the mind: their actuality is simply to be
  thought. Thinking itself consists of nothing else but being busy about
  such universals. Thus the actualization of the object of thought, and the
  operation of the thinker of thought, are one and the same.

## Will, mind, and soul in late antiquity

* Aristotle defined voluntariness as follows: something was voluntary if it
  was originated by an agent free from compulsion or error.
* Prohairesis (purposive choice): the choice of an action as part of an
  overall plan of life.
* Augustine: We have to distinguish three senses of ‘necessity’: nature,
  certainty, and compulsion. Nature and compulsion are incompatible with
  voluntariness, and only voluntary acts are blameable. Certainty is
  compatible with voluntariness: it may be certain that X will sin, and yet
  X will sin voluntarily and will rightly be blamed.
* Augustine offers to prove that wanting is in our power. On one
  interpretation his proof goes like this. Doing X is in our power if we do
  X whenever we want. But whenever we want, we want. Therefore wanting is in
  our power. This seems too easy: surely the first premise is incomplete. It
  should read: Doing X is in our power if we do X whenever we want to do X.
  The second premise would then have to read: whenever we want to want to do
  X we want to do X. This would give us Augustine's conclusion: whatever X
  is, wanting X is in our power. But one may question the second premise.
  May we not have a second-order want to want something, without having the
  first-order want itself?
* If it is in my power to do X, then it must be in my power not to do X.
  This weakens his argument to show that wanting is in our power. For
  whatever plausibility there is in the claim that if I want to want
  something I want it, there is none in the claim that if I want not to want
  something then I do not want it. I may very sincerely want to give up
  smoking: that does not prevent my passionate want for a cigarette at this
  moment.
* Augustine believed that at any moment God foreknew all future events. He
  can then construct the following argument against the possibility of
  voluntary sin.
  1. God foreknew that Adam was going to sin.
  2. If God foreknew that Adam was going to sin, necessarily Adam was going
     to sin.
  3. If Adam was necessarily going to sin, then Adam sinned necessarily.
  4. If Adam sinned necessarily, Adam did not sin of his own free will.
  5. Adam did not sin of his own free will.
* Augustine tries to disarm the argument by distinguishing between
  certainty, on one hand, and natural causation or compulsion, on the other.
  I can be certain that someone is about to do something without in any way
  compelling him to do it. Accordingly, we can distinguish the senses of
  ‘necessity’ in the argument above. In (2) and the antecedent of (3)
  necessarily must be taken as ‘certainly’. In (4) and the consequent of (3)
  ‘necessarily’ must be taken as ‘under compulsion’. Because of the
  resulting equivocation in (3), the argument fails.

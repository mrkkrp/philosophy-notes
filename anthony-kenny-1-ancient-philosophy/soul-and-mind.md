# Soul and mind

## Pythagoras' metempsychosis

* Pythagoras belived in transmigration of souls after death.
* Pythagoras took memory as a criterion of personal identity.

## The anatomy of soul

* The phenomena of mental conflict in Plato's republic: a man may be thirsty
  and yet unwilling to drink (perhaps because of doctor's orders): this
  shows that there is one part of the soul that reflects and a different one
  that feels bodily desires. The first can be called *reason* and the second
  *appetite*. Since anger is in conflict with both reason and appetite, we
  have to attribute it to a third element in the soul, which we can call
  temper. Justice in the soul is the harmony of these three elements.

## Aristotle's philosophical psychology

* For Aristotle, a soul is the actuality of a body that has life.
* Soul is the form of a natural, organic body.
* Aristotle's theoretical concept of soul differs from that of Plato before
  him and Descartes after him. A soul, for him, is not an interior,
  immaterial agent acting on a body. ‘We should not ask whether body and
  soul are one thing, any more than we should ask that question about the
  wax and the seal imprinted on it, or about the matter of anything and that
  of which it is the matter.’
* A sense-faculty in operation is identical with a sense-object in action:
  the actuality of the sense-object is one and the same as the actuality of
  the sense-faculty. The sweetness of a cup of tea is a sense-object,
  something that can be tasted. My ability to taste is a sense-faculty. The
  operation of the sense of taste upon the object of taste is the same thing
  as the action of the object upon my sense. That is to say, the tea's
  tasting sweet to me is one and the same event as my tasting the sweetness
  of the tea.
* The tea is actually sweet, whereas before the sugar was put in, it was
  only potentially sweet. The sweetness of the tea in the cup is a first
  actuality: the tea's actually tasting sweet to me is a second actuality.
  Sweetness is nothing other than the power to taste sweet to suitable
  tasters; and the faculty of taste is nothing other than the power to taste
  such things as the sweetness of sweet objects. Thus we can agree that the
  sensible property in operation is the same thing as the faculty in
  operation, though of course the power to taste and the power to be tasted
  are two different things, one in an animal and the other in a substance.
* The object we encounter in experience are only potentially, not actually,
  thinkable, just as colors in the dark are only potentially, not actually,
  visible. The active intellect creates concepts—actually thinkable
  objects—by abstracting universal forms from particular experience. These
  matterless forms exist only in the mind: their actuality is simply to be
  thought. Thinking itself consists of nothing else but being busy about
  such universals. Thus the actualization of the object of thought, and the
  operation of the thinker of thought, are one and the same.

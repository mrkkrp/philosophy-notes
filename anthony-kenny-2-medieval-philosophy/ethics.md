# Ethics

## Augustine on how to be happy

* Augustine bases his ethical teaching on the premise that everyone wants to
  be happy, and that it is the task of philosophy to define what this
  supreme good is and how it is to be achieved.
* Augustine claims that happiness is truly possible only in the vision of
  God in an afterlife. He argues that immortality of soul is a necessary but
  not sufficient condition for happiness, since e.g. he does not consider
  cycles of reincarnation as confirming to his idea of happiness.
* Virtue in the present life is not equivalent to happiness: it is merely a
  necessary means to an end that is ultimately other-worldly. Moreover,
  however hard we try, we are unable to avoid vice without grace, that is to
  say without special divine assistance, which is given only to those
  selected for salvation through Christ. The virtues of the great pagan
  heroes, celebrated from time to time in *The City of God*, were really
  only splendid vices, but did not quality for the one true happiness in
  heaven.
* In Augustine's moral teaching there is an element that has many of the
  same consequences as the pagan thesis of the inseparability of the moral
  virtues. This is the doctrine that the moral virtues are inseparable from
  the theological virtues. That is to say, someone who lacks the virtues of
  faith, hope, and charity cannot truly possess virtues such as wisdom,
  temperance, or courage. An act that is not done from the love of God must
  be sinful; and without orthodox faith one cannot have true love of God.

## Augustine on lying, murder, and sex

* Augustine wrote much concerning the interpretation of three of the Ten
  Commandments: ‘Thou shalt not kill’, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery’,
  ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor’.
* The prohibition to kill does not extend to the killing of non-human
  creatures. ‘They have not been endowed with reason as we have, and so it
  is by a just ordinance of the creator that their life and death is
  subordinate to our needs.’
* Augustine accepts that a public magistrate may be justified in inflicting
  the death penalty on a wrongdoer, provided that the sentence is imposed
  and carried out in accordance with the laws of the state.
* It is quite all right to kill in war, provided it is waged on the
  authority of God. It isn't clear when this condition is met though.
* According to Augustine suicide is unlawful. Suicide in the face of
  material deprivation is a mark of weakness, not greatness of soul. Suicide
  to avoid dishonor brings only greater dishonor. Suicide to escape rape
  falls even more firmly under Augustine's condemnation, because to be raped
  is no sin and should bring no shame on an unconsenting victim.
* Unlike Aristotle Augustine does not think that slavery is something
  natural. It is the result of sin: e.g. enslavement of the vanquished by
  the victors in an unjust war. However, he falls short of an outright
  condemnation, in this sinful world, of slavery as an institution: he is
  deterred from doing so by the example of the Old Testament patriarchs, and
  by Paul's injunctions in the New Testament to slaves to obey their
  masters.
* Augustine's teaching on sex and marriage became, with little modification,
  the standard doctrine of medieval moral philosophers. A. regards sex as
  permissible only in marriage, treats procreation as the principal purpose
  of marriage , and sets consequential limits on the types of sexual
  activity lawful between husband and wife. Otherwise his views are
  traditionalist, misogynist, and outdated.
* Lying is not permissible under any circumstances, even for a good cause.

## Abelard's ethic of intention

* It is not what is done, but with what mind it is done, that God weights;
  the desert and praise of the agent rests not in his action but in his
  intention.
* A bad intention may ruin a good act.
* More controversially, Abelard maintained that a good intention might
  justify a prohibited action.
* Bad intentions are as blameworthy as bad actions.
* In order to have a good intention, it is not sufficient that a man should
  believe that he is doing well. MK: what is the criterion for goodness of
  an intention then?
* It is not clear whether his doctrine of justification by intention means
  that an erroneous conscience excuses from guilt, or that a good end
  justifies means known to be evil. Abelard never clearly distinguished
  between the volitional and the cognitive element in intention. MK: not
  clear to me what exactly these two elements are.
* Abelard's doctrine came close to the slogan of 1960s hippies. ‘It doesn't
  matter what you do as long as you're sincere’, and it is not surprising
  that it was found shocking by his contemporaries, even though he believed
  that our grasp of natural law set a limit to the possibilities of sincere
  moral error. The Council of Sens condemned the teaching that those who
  killed Christ in good faith were free from sin; and also among the
  condemned propositions was ‘A man does not become better or worse on
  account of the works he does’.

## Aquinas' ethical system

* Aristotle in describing human action makes use of two key concepts: that
  of voluntariness and that of purpose. For him, something is voluntary if
  it is originated by an agent free from compulsion or error; it is a
  purpose if chosen as part of an overall plan of life. His concept of
  the voluntary was too broad and his concept of purpose too narrow to
  demarcate most of the moral choices of everyday life. While retaining and
  refining Aristotle's concepts, Aquinas introduced the concept of intention
  to fill the gap between the two of them.
* There are three types of action: those that are ends in themselves, those
  that are means to ends, and those that we do, perhaps reluctantly, as
  unavoidable accompaniments of actions of the first two kinds. It is in
  actions of the middle kind that we exhibit intention: we intend to achieve
  the end by the means. Actions of the third kind are not intentional, but
  merely voluntary. Voluntariness, then, is the broadest category; whatever
  is intentional is voluntary, but not vice versa. Intention itself, while
  not as broad as voluntariness, is a broader concept than Aristotle's
  purpose.
* Human acts may be divided into three categories in respect of moral
  evaluation. Some kinds of act are good, some are bad, and some are
  indifferent. Each individual action in the concrete will be performed in
  particular circumstances with a particular end in view. For an individual
  action to be morally good, it must belong to a class of acts that is not
  bad, it must take place in appropriate circumstances, and it must be done
  with a virtuous intention (MK: is there also moral classification of
  purposes?). If any of these elements is missing, it is a bad act (MK: may
  there not be indifferent acts then?). Consequently, a bad intention can
  spoil a good act, but a good intention cannot redeem a bad act. We may not
  do evil that good may come.
* Though an erroneous conscience always binds us, it does not always excuse
  us.
* Against Abelard Aquinas insists that good will cannot be fully genuine
  unless it is put into action when opportunity arises.
* For Aquinas, foresight is not the same thing as intention: a consequence
  may be foreseen without being intended.
* The reproduction of a nature, which is the result of the process of
  generation, is also the point and purpose of that process. St
  Thomas believed that each nature had itself a point no less than the
  process that reproduced it. This must be so, it might well seem, if
  reproduction itself were to serve any purpose. Bringing humans into being
  would have no point unless being a human had some point other than
  bringing other humans into being. ‘The nature of a thing,’ St Thomas
  wrote, ‘which is the goal of its production, is itself directed to another
  goal, which is either an action, or the product of an action’. Thus it
  might be that the point of being a glow-worm was to shine, and the point
  of being a bee was to make honey. Obviously, it is a matter of great
  importance, if this line of reasoning is correct, to have a correct view
  of what is the point of being a human.
* The point of being a human is contemplation of God, and for this they need
  besides moral virtues, the theological virtues of faith, hope, and
  charity.
* Aquinas seeks to reconcile Aristotelian with biblical ethics. For
  Aristotle it is reason that sets the goal of action, and provides the
  standard by which actions are to be regarded as virtuous or vicious; in
  the Bible the standard is set by a code of laws. There is no conflict,
  Aquinas maintains, because law is a product of reason. Reflection on the
  essence of human action and choice, as described by Aristotle, leads to
  the formation of a set of ultimate practical principles to guide the
  activity of virtue in which human flourishing consists. Among these
  ultimate principles is the biblical injunction to love one's neighbor as
  oneself: a principle that Aquinas regarded as the first and common precept
  of human nature, self-evident to human reason (MK: if only it were
  indeed).

## Scotus on divine law

* Scotus agrees with Aristotle and Aquinas that human beings have a natural
  tendency to pursue happiness; but, in addition, he postulates a natural
  tendency to pursue justice.
* In the eudaimonistic tradition freedom is conceived as the ability to
  choose between different possible means to happiness; and wrongdoing is
  represented as the outcome of a failure to apprehend the appropriate
  means. For Scotus, freedom extends not just to the choice of means to a
  predetermined end, but to a choice between independent and possibly
  competing ultimate goals. The blame for wrongdoing is placed less on a
  defective understanding, more on the waywardness of an autonomous will.
* For Scotus, an action could be wrong simply because God had forbidden it,
  whether or not it had any relevance to the fulfillment or non-fulfillment
  of human nature.
* Just as Scotus' theory extends the degree of choice available to the human
  will subject to the divine law, so it extends the degree of freedom
  possessed by God in issuing commands to the human will. St Thomas had held
  that all of the Ten Commandments belonged to the natural law: it followed
  that God could not dispense from them, could not give permission for
  humans to act against them. Scotus agreed that no exceptions could be
  permitted to commandments belonging to the natural law; but he disagreed
  that all ten Commandments formed part of that law.
* There are some commands that God could not possibly give: he could not,
  for instance, command anyone to hate him, or blaspheme against him. Truths
  such as ‘God must be loved above all things’ are necessarily true, prior
  to any decision of God's will. God cannot dispense from such a law, and
  law of this kind are the kernel of morality, the true natural law. In
  maintaining this, Scotus shows that he did not accept what is sometimes
  called the divine command theory of morality, according to which the moral
  value of any action whatever consists nothing other than its prescription
  or prohibition by God. But it is only commands that have God himself as
  their object that strictly belong to the natural law.
* It is true that murder is a bad action, but this is a contingent, not a
  necessary, truth. The principles that find expression in the later
  Commandments can be said to belong to the law of natural only in an
  extended sense. In giving these commands, God exhibits justice towards his
  creatures: but he can override them, when necessary, in the interests of a
  higher justice. God is under no necessity to treat his creatures justly at
  all: the infinite owes no obligation to the finite.
* Two important consequences follow from Scotus' ethical theory. The first
  is a limitation on human capacity for moral reasoning; the second is an
  externalization of the notion of sin. The natural law is the moral law
  that is capable of being discovered by natural reason: but if those
  principles that concern human beings' relations to each other are not part
  of the natural law, then, however plausibly they can be argued for, we can
  only be certain of them in virtue of revelation. An act in breach of
  divine law places one in a state of sin; but this does not, according to
  Scotus, effect any internal change in the sinner. Guilt is not an
  intrinsic property of the human offender: it is simply the external fact
  that God has resolved on punishment. Both of these Scotist theses were to
  become fundamental issues of controversy at the time of the Reformation.

## The ethics of Ockham

* Ockham agrees with Scotus that freedom is the fundamental feature of human
  beings, and that the will is independent of reason. ‘Every man experiences
  that however much reason may dictate a thing, his will can either will it
  or fail to will it or will its opposite.’ Even the choice of the ultimate
  end is free: a man may refuse to make happiness his goal, in the belief
  that it is a state unattainable by the kind of human beings we find
  ourselves to be.
* Ockham emphasizes the absolute freedom of God in laying down the divine
  law. Whereas Scotus accepted that some precepts (e.g. the command to love
  God) were part of the natural law, and derived their force not from the
  free decision of God but from his very nature, Ockham taught that the
  moral value of human acts derived entirely from God's sovereign,
  unfettered, will. God, in his absolute power, could command adultery or
  theft, and if he did so such acts would not only cease to be sinful but
  become obligatory.
* Obligation is a central ethical concept for Ockham. Evil is defined as
  being an action performed under an obligation to do the opposite. Humans
  are obliged by the divine commands; but God is under no obligation to
  human beings.
* Ockham, like his Aristotelian predecessors, says from time to time that
  what makes an act virtuous is that it should be in accordance with correct
  rational judgment and that it should be performed precisely for that
  reason. He follows tradition in saying that a person must act in
  accordance with their conscience (i.e. their rational moral judgment) even
  if it is in error. But these Aristotelian remarks are not in conflict with
  the fundamentally authoritarian nature of his ethic. If we are to follow
  reason and conscience, this is because God has commanded us to do so.
* For Ockham the true subject matter of morality are not public actions, but
  rather private, interior, acts of willing. No external act can have, in
  itself, a moral value, because any external act is capable of being
  performed by a madman, who is incapable of virtuous action. An action
  carried out in conformity with a virtuous will has no moral value
  additional to the moral value of the willing. The very same act of walking
  to church is virtuous if done out of piety, vicious if done for vainglory.

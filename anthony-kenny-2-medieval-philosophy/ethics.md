## Augustine on how to be happy

* Augustine bases his ethical teaching on the premise that everyone wants to
  be happy, and that it is the task of philosophy to define what this
  supreme good is and how it is to be achieved.
* Augustine claims that happiness is truly possible only in the vision of
  God in an afterlife. He argues that immortality of soul is a necessary but
  not sufficient condition for happiness, since e.g. he does not consider
  cycles of reincarnation as confirming to his idea of happiness.
* Virtue in the present life is not equivalent to happiness: it is merely a
  necessary means to an end that is ultimately other-worldly. Moreover,
  however hard we try, we are unable to avoid vice without grace, that is to
  say without special divine assistance, which is given only to those
  selected for salvation through Christ. The virtues of the great pagan
  heroes, celebrated from time to time in *The City of God*, were really
  only splendid vices, but did not quality for the one true happiness in
  heaven.
* In Augustine's moral teaching there is an element that has many of the
  same consequences as the pagan thesis of the inseparability of the moral
  virtues. This is the doctrine that the moral virtues are inseparable from
  the theological virtues. That is to say, someone who lacks the virtues of
  faith, hope, and charity cannot truly possess virtues such as wisdom,
  temperance, or courage. An act that is not done from the love of God must
  be sinful; and without orthodox faith one cannot have true love of God.

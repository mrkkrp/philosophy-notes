# Ethics

## Augustine on how to be happy

* Augustine bases his ethical teaching on the premise that everyone wants to
  be happy, and that it is the task of philosophy to define what this
  supreme good is and how it is to be achieved.
* Augustine claims that happiness is truly possible only in the vision of
  God in an afterlife. He argues that immortality of soul is a necessary but
  not sufficient condition for happiness, since e.g. he does not consider
  cycles of reincarnation as confirming to his idea of happiness.
* Virtue in the present life is not equivalent to happiness: it is merely a
  necessary means to an end that is ultimately other-worldly. Moreover,
  however hard we try, we are unable to avoid vice without grace, that is to
  say without special divine assistance, which is given only to those
  selected for salvation through Christ. The virtues of the great pagan
  heroes, celebrated from time to time in *The City of God*, were really
  only splendid vices, but did not quality for the one true happiness in
  heaven.
* In Augustine's moral teaching there is an element that has many of the
  same consequences as the pagan thesis of the inseparability of the moral
  virtues. This is the doctrine that the moral virtues are inseparable from
  the theological virtues. That is to say, someone who lacks the virtues of
  faith, hope, and charity cannot truly possess virtues such as wisdom,
  temperance, or courage. An act that is not done from the love of God must
  be sinful; and without orthodox faith one cannot have true love of God.

## Augustine on lying, murder, and sex

* Augustine wrote much concerning the interpretation of three of the Ten
  Commandments: ‘Thou shalt not kill’, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery’,
  ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor’.
* The prohibition to kill does not extend to the killing of non-human
  creatures. ‘They have not been endowed with reason as we have, and so it
  is by a just ordinance of the creator that their life and death is
  subordinate to our needs.’
* Augustine accepts that a public magistrate may be justified in inflicting
  the death penalty on a wrongdoer, provided that the sentence is imposed
  and carried out in accordance with the laws of the state.
* It is quite all right to kill in war, provided it is waged on the
  authority of God. It isn't clear when this condition is met though.
* According to Augustine suicide is unlawful. Suicide in the face of
  material deprivation is a mark of weakness, not greatness of soul. Suicide
  to avoid dishonor brings only greater dishonor. Suicide to escape rape
  falls even more firmly under Augustine's condemnation, because to be raped
  is no sin and should bring no shame on an unconsenting victim.
* Unlike Aristotle Augustine does not think that slavery is something
  natural. It is the result of sin: e.g. enslavement of the vanquished by
  the victors in an unjust war. However, he falls short of an outright
  condemnation, in this sinful world, of slavery as an institution: he is
  deterred from doing so by the example of the Old Testament patriarchs, and
  by Paul's injunctions in the New Testament to slaves to obey their
  masters.
* Augustine's teaching on sex and marriage became, with little modification,
  the standard doctrine of medieval moral philosophers. A. regards sex as
  permissible only in marriage, treats procreation as the principal purpose
  of marriage , and sets consequential limits on the types of sexual
  activity lawful between husband and wife. Otherwise his views are
  traditionalist, misogynist, and outdated.
* Lying is not permissible under any circumstances, even for a good cause.

## Abelard's ethic of intention

* It is not what is done, but with what mind it is done, that God weights;
  the desert and praise of the agent rests not in his action but in his
  intention.
* A bad intention may ruin a good act.
* More controversially, Abelard maintained that a good intention might
  justify a prohibited action.
* Bad intentions are as blameworthy as bad actions.
* In order to have a good intention, it is not sufficient that a man should
  believe that he is doing well. MK: what is the criterion for goodness of
  an intention then?
* It is not clear whether his doctrine of justification by intention means
  that an erroneous conscience excuses from guilt, or that a good end
  justifies means known to be evil. Abelard never clearly distinguished
  between the volitional and the cognitive element in intention. MK: not
  clear to me what exactly these two elements are.
* Abelard's doctrine came close to the slogan of 1960s hippies. ‘It doesn't
  matter what you do as long as you're sincere’, and it is not surprising
  that it was found shocking by his contemporaries, even though he believed
  that our grasp of natural law set a limit to the possibilities of sincere
  moral error. The Council of Sens condemned the teaching that those who
  killed Christ in good faith were free from sin; and also among the
  condemned propositions was ‘A man does not become better or worse on
  account of the works he does’.

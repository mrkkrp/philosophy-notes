# God

## The God of Augustine

* Augustine believes that he can philosophically prove existence of God.
* Augustine grades different faculties in a hierarchy—inner sense is
  superior to outer senses, reason is superior to inner sense—on the basis
  that if A makes judgments about B, then A is superior to B. Within us
  nothing is superior to reason. But if we find something outside ourselves
  superior to reason, Augustine asks, shall we call that God?
* Among the highest things in the human mind are knowledge of numbers and
  judgments of value (wisdom). What arithmetic and wisdom have in common is
  that both are true and unchangeably true and contained in a single
  unchangeable truth.
* This truth is not the property of any human individual: it is shareable by
  everyone. The immutable truth is superior to our minds (since we do not
  pass judgments about it); it sets the standard by which we judge our
  minds.
* So, we have found something superior to the human mind and reason. Is this
  God? Only if there is nothing that is superior to it. If there is anything
  more excellent than truth, then that is God; if not, then truth itself is
  God.
* For Augustine one of the most important things we can know about God is
  that he is *simple*.
* A nature is called simple when there is nothing that it has that it can
  lose, and when there is no difference between what it is and what it has.
  A vessel contains liquid, a body has a color, the atmosphere has light and
  heat, a soul has wisdom. The vessel is not the same as the liquid, a body
  is not the same as its color, the atmosphere is not the same as its light
  and heat, the soul is not its wisdom. Such things can lose what they have,
  and change, gaining different qualities and attributes.
* A simple being is unchangeable, but that is not enough. It also must lack
  contemporaneous parts. Anything that is corporeal is extended, having
  parts that are spatially distinct from each other. The one simple God
  cannot be corporeal, cannot be extended in space.
* Something might be immutable and unextended and yet not be simple if it
  had a set of distinct everlasting attributes. In God, Augustine believed,
  all the divine attributes are in some way identical with each other and
  with the divine substance in which they inhere.
* One of the most important attributes of God is his goodness. Just as God
  gives being to his creatures, so too he gives them goodness. All that he
  created is good by nature. Where then does evil come from? In his youth
  Augustine had subscribed to the Manichaean view that there were two
  supreme principles controlling the universe, one good and one evil, in
  conflict with each other. As a Christian he gave up belief in the evil
  principle, but this did not mean that he believed that the good God was
  the cause of evil. Evil is only a privation of good, it is not a positive
  reality and does not need a causal principle. Any evil in creatures is
  simply loss of good—of integrity, beauty, health, or virtue.
* Augustine believes that an evil human choice has no cause. The freedom of
  the will is of course a gift of God, and the freedom of the will carries
  with it the possibility of the misuse of that freedom.

## Boethius on divine foreknowledge

* In a world governed by divine providence, can there be any such thing as
  luck or change? Lady Philosophy says that if by chance we mean an event
  produced by random motion without any chain of causes, then there is no
  such thing as chance. The only kind of chance is that defined by Aristotle
  as the unexpected effect of coinciding causes. In that case, Boethius
  asks, does the casual network leave any room for free human choice or does
  the chain of fate bind even the motions of our minds? If God foresees all,
  and cannot be in error, then what he foresees must happen of necessity.
  For if it is possible for our deeds and desires to turn out in any way
  other than God has foreseen, then it is possible for God to be in error.
  Even if in fact all turns out as he foresaw, his foresight can only have
  been conjecture, not true knowledge.
* Boethius admits knowledge does not, in itself, cause what is known. But
  necessity is different from causality; and ‘If you know that I am sitting,
  then I am sitting’ is a necessary truth. So, too, ‘If God knows that I
  will sin, I will sin’ is a necessary truth. Surely that is enough to
  destroy our free will, and with it all justification for reward or
  punishment for human actions. On the other hand, if it is still possible
  for me not to sin, and God thinks that I will sin, then he is in error—a
  blasphemous suggestion!
* Lady Philosophy accepts that a genuinely free action cannot be foreseen
  with certainty. But we can observe, without any room for doubt, something
  happening in the present. When we watch a charioteer steering his horses
  round a racetrack, neither our vision nor anything else necessitates his
  skillful management of his team. God's knowledge of our future actions is
  like our knowledge of others' present actions: he is outside time, and his
  seeing is not really a *foreseeing*. ‘The same future event, when it is
  related to divine knowledge, is necessary; but when it is considered in
  its own nature can be seen to be utterly free and unconditional… God
  beholds as present those future events that happen because of freewill.’
* While explaining that God is outside of time, Boethius produced a
  definition of eternity that became canonical. ‘Eternity is the whole and
  perfect possession, all at once, of endless life.’ God possesses the whole
  of his life simultaneously; none of it has flowed into the past and none
  of it is still waiting in the wings.

## Negative theology in Eriugena

* God is not in any of Aristotle's categories, so all the things that are
  can be denied of him—that is negative theology. On the other hand, God is
  the cause of all the things that are, so they can all be affirmed of him.
  But all terms that we apply to God are applied to him only improperly and
  metaphorically. Because affirmative theology is merely metaphorical it is
  not in conflict with negative theology, which is literally true.
* God's essence is unknown to men and angels: indeed, it is unknown to God
  himself. Just as I, human being, know *that* I am, but not *what* I am, so
  God does not know what he is. If he did, he would be able to define
  himself; but the infinite cannot be defined. It is no insult to God to say
  that he does not know what he is; for he is not a *what*.

## Islamic arguments for God's existence

* Al-Kindi offers a series of elaborate and systematic proofs for the
  existence of God, based on establishing the finite nature of the world we
  live in. Suppose that the physical world were infinite in quantity. I we
  take out of it a finite quantity, is what is left finite or infinite? If
  finite, then if we restore what has been taken out, we have only a finite
  quantity, since the addition of two finite quantities cannot make an
  infinite one. If infinite, then if we restore what has been taken out, we
  will have two infinite bodies, one (the original) smaller than the other
  (the restored whole). But this is absurd. So the universe must be finite
  in space. MK: he would be surprised to discover that the notion of unequal
  infinities is not at all absurd.
* Similar considerations show that the universe is finite in time. Time is
  quantitative, and an actually infinite quantity cannot exist. If time were
  infinite, then an infinite number of prior times must have preceded the
  present moment. But an infinite number cannot be traversed; so if time
  were infinite we would never have got to the present moment, which is
  absurd.
* If time is finite, then the universe must have had a beginning in time;
  for the universe cannot exist without time. But if the universe had a
  beginning, then it must have had a cause other than itself. This cause
  must be the cause of the multiplicity to be found in the universe, and
  this al-Kindi calls the True One. This, he tells us, is the cause of the
  beginning of coming to be in the universe, and is the cause of the unity
  that holds each creature together.
* Christians as well as Muslims found it convenient that philosophical
  arguments could be offered for the creation of the world in time, so that
  the believer did not need to take this simply on faith, on the authority
  of Genesis or the Quran. The arguments which al-Kindi brought into Islam
  from Philoponus returned into the Christian world in the high Middle Ages,
  and their validity became a matter of debate among the major scholaistics.
* Not all Muslim philosophers agreed that the world was created in time.
  Avicenna believed that God created by necessity: he is absolute goodness,
  and goodness by its nature radiates outwards.
* Avicenna offers a proof that there must be at least one thing that is
  necessarily existent of itself. Start with any entity you choose—it can be
  anything in heaven or on earth. If this is necessarily existent of itself,
  then our thesis is proved. If it is contingently existent of itself, then
  it is necessarily existent through something else. This second entity is
  necessarily existent either of itself, or through something else. If
  through something else, then there is a third entity, and so on. However
  long the series is, it cannot end with something that is of itself
  contingent; for that, and thus the whole series, would need a cause to
  explain its existence. Even if the complete casual series is infinite, it
  must contain at least one cause that is necessarily existent of itself,
  because if it contained only contingent causes it would need an external
  cause and thus not be complete. MK: this last argument is dubious, the way
  such a series is defined it always ends with a necessary cause, so there
  cannot be a series of this kind that both is infinite and contains a
  necessary cause.
* Avicenna argues that there can be at most one necessary being. It is
  perfect, it is pure goodness, it is truth, it is pure intelligence; it is
  source of everything else's beauty and splendor. The most important
  feature of the necessary being is that it does not have an essence which
  is other than its existence. If it did, there would have to be a cause to
  unite the essence with the existence, and the necessary being would be not
  necessary but caused.

## Anselm's proof of God

* The ontological argument is thus stated by Anselm:
  > We believe that thou art something than which nothing greater can be
  > conceived. Suppose there is no such nature, according to what the fool
  > says in his heart *There is no God*. But at any rate this very fool,
  > when he hears what I am saying—something than which nothing greater can
  > be conceived—understands what he hears. What he understands is in his
  > understanding, even if he does not understand that it exists. For, it is
  > one thing for an object to be in the understanding, and another to
  > understand that that object exists… Even the fool, then, is bound to
  > agree that there exists, if only in the understanding, something than
  > which nothing greater can be conceived; because he hears this and
  > understands it, and whatever is understood is in the understanding. But
  > for sure, that than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot exist
  > in the understanding alone. For suppose it exists in the understanding
  > alone: then it can be thought to exist in reality, which is greater.
  > Therefore, if that than which nothing greater can be conceived exists in
  > the understanding alone, that very thing than which nothing greater can
  > be conceived is a thing than which something greater can be conceived.
  > But this is impossible. Therefore it is beyond doubt that there exists,
  > both in the understanding and in reality, a being than which nothing
  > greater can be conceived.
* Whereas Avicenna said that God's essence entailed his existence, Anselm
  argues that the very *concept* of God makes manifest that he exists.
* Bertrand Russell: ‘This argument was invented by Anselm, rejected by
  Thomas Aquinas, accepted by Descartes, refuted by Kant, and reinstated by
  Hegel. I think it may be said quite decisively that, as a result of
  analysis of the concept “existence”, modern logic has proved this argument
  invalid.’ But the argument was not as definitively settled as Russel
  thought. When a later generation of logicians developed the modal logic of
  possible worlds, theistic philosophers made use of this logic to resurrect
  the ontological argument. MK: would be nice to cover that!
* The weak element in Anselm's argument is the one that seems most
  innocuous: his definition of God. How does he know that ‘something than
  which no greater can be conceived’ expresses a coherent notion? May the
  expression be as misbegotten as ‘a natural number than which no greater
  can be found’? Anselm himself seems to have sensed a problem here. He is
  at pains to point out that his definition does not imply that God is the
  greatest conceivable thing. Indeed, God is *not* conceivable: he is
  greater than anything that can be conceived. So far, so good: there is
  nothing contradictory in saying that than which no greater can be
  conceived is itself too great for conception. The real problem for Anselm
  is in explaining how something that cannot be conceived can be in the
  understanding at all. His last word on the issue amounts to admitting that
  what's in the fool's understanding is only a set of words, not God
  himself, hence the argument cannot get started.

## Omnipotence in Damiani and Abelard

* Diamani: If God cannot do any of the things that he does not want to do,
  since he never does anything except what he wants to do, it follows that
  he cannot do anything at all except what he does. As a result we shall
  have to say frankly that God is not making it rain today because he
  cannot.
* Abelard raised the question whether God can make more things, or better
  things, than the things he has made, and whether he can refrain from
  acting as he does. If God can make more and better things than he has, is
  it not mean of him not to do so? After all, it costs him no effort.
  Whatever he does, or refrains from doing, is done or left undone for the
  best possible reasons, however hidden from us these may be. So it seems
  that God cannot act except in the way he has in fact acted. On the other
  hand, if we take any sinner on his way to damnation, it is clear that he
  could be better than he is; for if not, he is not to be blamed, still less
  to be damned, for his sins. But if he could be better, then God could make
  him better; so there is something that God could make better than he has.
* Suppose it is now not raining: this must be because God so wills. That
  must mean that now is not a good time for rain. So if we say that God
  could now make it rain, we are attributing to God the power to do
  something foolish. Whatever God wants to do, he can, but if he doesn't
  want to, then he can't. It is true that we poor creatures can act
  otherwise than we do (MK: do or ought to do?); but this is not something
  to be proud of, it is a mark of our infirmity, like our ability to walk,
  eat, and sin. We would be better off without the ability to do what we
  ought not to do.
* In answer to the argument that sinners must be capable of salvation if
  they are to be justly punished, Abelard rejects the step from ‘This sinner
  can be saved by God’ to ‘God can save this sinner’. The underlying logical
  principle—that ‘p if and only if q’ entails ‘possibly p if and only if
  possibly q’—is invalid, he claims, and encounters many counter-examples.
  One might object that God would deserve no gratitude from men if he cannot
  do otherwise than he does. But Abelard has an answer. God is not acting
  under compulsion: his will is identical with goodness that necessitates
  him to act as he does.

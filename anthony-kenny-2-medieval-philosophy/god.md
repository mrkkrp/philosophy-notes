# God

## The God of Augustine

* Augustine believes that he can philosophically prove existence of God.
* Augustine grades different faculties in a hierarchy—inner sense is
  superior to outer senses, reason is superior to inner sense—on the basis
  that if A makes judgments about B, then A is superior to B. Within us
  nothing is superior to reason. But if we find something outside ourselves
  superior to reason, Augustine asks, shall we call that God?
* Among the highest things in the human mind are knowledge of numbers and
  judgments of value (wisdom). What arithmetic and wisdom have in common is
  that both are true and unchangeably true and contained in a single
  unchangeable truth.
* This truth is not the property of any human individual: it is shareable by
  everyone. The immutable truth is superior to our minds (since we do not
  pass judgments about it); it sets the standard by which we judge our
  minds.
* So, we have found something superior to the human mind and reason. Is this
  God? Only if there is nothing that is superior to it. If there is anything
  more excellent than truth, then that is God; if not, then truth itself is
  God.
* For Augustine one of the most important things we can know about God is
  that he is *simple*.
* A nature is called simple when there is nothing that it has that it can
  lose, and when there is no difference between what it is and what it has.
  A vessel contains liquid, a body has a color, the atmosphere has light and
  heat, a soul has wisdom. The vessel is not the same as the liquid, a body
  is not the same as its color, the atmosphere is not the same as its light
  and heat, the soul is not its wisdom. Such things can lose what they have,
  and change, gaining different qualities and attributes.
* A simple being is unchangeable, but that is not enough. It also must lack
  contemporaneous parts. Anything that is corporeal is extended, having
  parts that are spatially distinct from each other. The one simple God
  cannot be corporeal, cannot be extended in space.
* Something might be immutable and unextended and yet not be simple if it
  had a set of distinct everlasting attributes. In God, Augustine believed,
  all the divine attributes are in some way identical with each other and
  with the divine substance in which they inhere.
* One of the most important attributes of God is his goodness. Just as God
  gives being to his creatures, so too he gives them goodness. All that he
  created is good by nature. Where then does evil come from? In his youth
  Augustine had subscribed to the Manichaean view that there were two
  supreme principles controlling the universe, one good and one evil, in
  conflict with each other. As a Christian he gave up belief in the evil
  principle, but this did not mean that he believed that the good God was
  the cause of evil. Evil is only a privation of good, it is not a positive
  reality and does not need a causal principle. Any evil in creatures is
  simply loss of good—of integrity, beauty, health, or virtue.
* Augustine believes that an evil human choice has no cause. The freedom of
  the will is of course a gift of God, and the freedom of the will carries
  with it the possibility of the misuse of that freedom.

## Boethius on divine foreknowledge

* In a world governed by divine providence, can there be any such thing as
  luck or change? Lady Philosophy says that if by chance we mean an event
  produced by random motion without any chain of causes, then there is no
  such thing as chance. The only kind of chance is that defined by Aristotle
  as the unexpected effect of coinciding causes. In that case, Boethius
  asks, does the casual network leave any room for free human choice or does
  the chain of fate bind even the motions of our minds? If God foresees all,
  and cannot be in error, then what he foresees must happen of necessity.
  For if it is possible for our deeds and desires to turn out in any way
  other than God has foreseen, then it is possible for God to be in error.
  Even if in fact all turns out as he foresaw, his foresight can only have
  been conjecture, not true knowledge.
* Boethius admits knowledge does not, in itself, cause what is known. But
  necessity is different from causality; and ‘If you know that I am sitting,
  then I am sitting’ is a necessary truth. So, too, ‘If God knows that I
  will sin, I will sin’ is a necessary truth. Surely that is enough to
  destroy our free will, and with it all justification for reward or
  punishment for human actions. On the other hand, if it is still possible
  for me not to sin, and God thinks that I will sin, then he is in error—a
  blasphemous suggestion!
* Lady Philosophy accepts that a genuinely free action cannot be foreseen
  with certainty. But we can observe, without any room for doubt, something
  happening in the present. When we watch a charioteer steering his horses
  round a racetrack, neither our vision nor anything else necessitates his
  skillful management of his team. God's knowledge of our future actions is
  like our knowledge of others' present actions: he is outside time, and his
  seeing is not really a *foreseeing*. ‘The same future event, when it is
  related to divine knowledge, is necessary; but when it is considered in
  its own nature can be seen to be utterly free and unconditional… God
  beholds as present those future events that happen because of freewill.’
* While explaining that God is outside of time, Boethius produced a
  definition of eternity that became canonical. ‘Eternity is the whole and
  perfect possession, all at once, of endless life.’ God possesses the whole
  of his life simultaneously; none of it has flowed into the past and none
  of it is still waiting in the wings.

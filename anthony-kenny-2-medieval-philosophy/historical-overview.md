# Historical overview

## Augustine of Hippo (13 November 354–28 August 430)

* *Contra Academicos* seeks to sift the true from the false in skepticism.
* *Confessions*—a playful dialogue with God tracing the course of his life
  from childhood to conversion.
* *On the Trinity*—an analysis of biblical and ecclesiastical texts
  concerning the mystery of three persons in one God.
* The most massive and most laborious of Augustine's works was *The City of
  God*, on which he worked from 413 to 426. Though dependent on the Bible on
  almost every page, *The City of God* deserves a significant place in the
  history of philosophy, for two reasons. In the first place, Augustine
  constantly strives to place his religious world-view into the
  philosophical tradition of Greece and Rome: where possible he tries to
  harmonize the Bible with Plato and Cicero; where this is not possible he
  feels obliged to recite and refute philosophical anti-Christian arguments.
  Secondly, the narrative Augustine constructed out of biblical and
  classical elements provided the framework for philosophical discussion in
  the Latin world up to and beyond the Renaissance and the Reformation.

## Boethius (c. 480–524 AD)

* Matters within the province of fortune are insignificant by comparison
  with values within oneself. The gifts of fortune that we enjoy do not
  really belong to us: riches may be lost, and are most valuable when we are
  giving them away. A splendid household is a blessing to me only if my
  servants are honest, and their virtue belongs to them not me. Political
  power may end in murder or slavery; and even while it is possessed it is
  trivial. The inhabited world is only a quarter of our globe; our globe is
  minute in comparison with the celestial sphere; for a man to boast of his
  power is like a mouse crowing over other mice. The greatest of fame lasts
  only a few years that add up to zero in comparison with never-ending
  eternity. I cannot find happiness in wealth, power, or fame, buy only in
  my most precious possession, myself.
* Good fortune is deceitful, constant only in her inconstancy; bad fortune
  brings men self-knowledge and teaches them who are their true friends, the
  most precious of all kinds of riches.
* ‘If God foresees all and cannot in any way be mistaken, then that must
  necessarily happen which in his providence he foresees will be.’ The reply
  offered is that God is outside time, and so it is a mistake to speak of
  providence as involving foreknowledge at all.

## John Scotus Eriugena (c.800–c.877)

* Developed his own version of Neoplatonism.

## Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037)

* Avicenna's main philosophical encyclopedia was called in Arabic
  *Kitab-al-Shifa*, or ‘Book of Healing’. It is divided into four parts, of
  which the first three treat of logic, physics, and mathematics
  respectively. The second part includes a development of Aristotle's *De
  Anima*. The fourth part, whose Arabic name means ‘Of divine things’, was
  known in the medieval west as his *Metaphysics*. When translated into
  Latin in Toledo around 1150 it had an enormous influence on the Latin
  philosophy of the Middle ages.

## Solomon Ibn Gabirol (c.1021–1058)

* Fundamentally Neoplatonic with a neo-Aristotelian element.

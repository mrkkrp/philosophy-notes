# Historical overview

## Augustine of Hippo (13 November 354–28 August 430)

* *Contra Academicos* seeks to sift the true from the false in skepticism.
* *Confessions*—a playful dialogue with God tracing the course of his life
  from childhood to conversion.
* *On the Trinity*—an analysis of biblical and ecclesiastical texts
  concerning the mystery of three persons in one God.
* The most massive and most laborious of Augustine's works was *The City of
  God*, on which he worked from 413 to 426. Though dependent on the Bible on
  almost every page, *The City of God* deserves a significant place in the
  history of philosophy, for two reasons. In the first place, Augustine
  constantly strives to place his religious world-view into the
  philosophical tradition of Greece and Rome: where possible he tries to
  harmonize the Bible with Plato and Cicero; where this is not possible he
  feels obliged to recite and refute philosophical anti-Christian arguments.
  Secondly, the narrative Augustine constructed out of biblical and
  classical elements provided the framework for philosophical discussion in
  the Latin world up to and beyond the Renaissance and the Reformation.

## Boethius (c. 480–524 AD)

* Matters within the province of fortune are insignificant by comparison
  with values within oneself. The gifts of fortune that we enjoy do not
  really belong to us: riches may be lost, and are most valuable when we are
  giving them away. A splendid household is a blessing to me only if my
  servants are honest, and their virtue belongs to them not me. Political
  power may end in murder or slavery; and even while it is possessed it is
  trivial. The inhabited world is only a quarter of our globe; our globe is
  minute in comparison with the celestial sphere; for a man to boast of his
  power is like a mouse crowing over other mice. The greatest of fame lasts
  only a few years that add up to zero in comparison with never-ending
  eternity. I cannot find happiness in wealth, power, or fame, buy only in
  my most precious possession, myself.
* Good fortune is deceitful, constant only in her inconstancy; bad fortune
  brings men self-knowledge and teaches them who are their true friends, the
  most precious of all kinds of riches.
* ‘If God foresees all and cannot in any way be mistaken, then that must
  necessarily happen which in his providence he foresees will be.’ The reply
  offered is that God is outside time, and so it is a mistake to speak of
  providence as involving foreknowledge at all.

## John Scotus Eriugena (c.800–c.877)

* Developed his own version of Neoplatonism.

## Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037)

* Avicenna's main philosophical encyclopedia was called in Arabic
  *Kitab-al-Shifa*, or ‘Book of Healing’. It is divided into four parts, of
  which the first three treat of logic, physics, and mathematics
  respectively. The second part includes a development of Aristotle's *De
  Anima*. The fourth part, whose Arabic name means ‘Of divine things’, was
  known in the medieval west as his *Metaphysics*. When translated into
  Latin in Toledo around 1150 it had an enormous influence on the Latin
  philosophy of the Middle ages.

## Solomon Ibn Gabirol (c.1021–1058)

* Fundamentally Neoplatonic with a neo-Aristotelian element.

## Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109)

* *Monologion* has as its purpose to teach students how to meditate upon the
  nature of God.
* In *Proslogion* Anselm puts forward his celebrated argument for the
  existence of God as that than which nothing greater can be conceived. It
  is on this argument (commonly called the ‘ontological argument’) that his
  philosophical fame principally rests.
* ‘I do not aim, Lord, to penetrate your profundity, because I know my
  intellect is no kind of match for it; but I want to understand in some
  small measure that truth of years that my heart believes and loves. For I
  do not seek to understand that I may believe; but I believe that I may
  understand. For I believe this too, that unless I believe, I shall not
  understand.’
* *On truth* analysis different applications of the word ‘true’—to
  sentences, to thoughts, to sense-perceptions, to actions, and to things.
  It concludes that there is only a single truth in all things, which is
  identical with justice.
* *On free will* explores to what extent human beings are capable of
  avoiding sin.
* *On the fall of the Devil* deals with one of the most excruciating
  versions of the problem of evil: how could initially good angels,
  supremely intelligent and with no carnal temptations, turn away from God,
  the only true source of happiness.
* In *Why did God become man* Anselm finds an original justification for the
  Christian doctrine of the Incarnation. Justice demands, he says, that
  where there is an offense, there must be satisfaction: the offender must
  offer a recompense that si equal and opposite to the offense. In feudal
  style, he argues that the magnitude of an offense is judged by the
  important of the person offended, while the magnitude of a recompense is
  judged by the importance of the person making it. Human sin is infinite
  offense, since it is offense against God; human recompense is only finite,
  since it is made by a creature. Unaided, therefore, the human race is
  incapable of making satisfaction for the sins of Adam and his heirs.
  Satisfaction can only be adequate if it is made by one who is human (and
  therefore an heir of Adam) and also divine (and therefore capable of
  making infinite recompense). Hence the necessity of the Incarnation.

## Abelard (1079–1142)

* Contributions to logic (3 logical treatises survive).
* One of Abelard's works that had the greatest subsequent influence was his
  *Sic et Non*, which places in opposition to each other texts on the same
  topic by different scriptural or patristic authorities. This collection
  was not made with skeptical intent, in order to cast doubpt on the
  authority of the sacred and ecclesiastical writers; rather, the paired
  texts were set out in a systematic pattern in order to stimulate his own,
  and others', reflection on the points at issue. Later, in the heyday of
  medieval universities, a favorite teaching method was the academic
  disputation. Abelard's *Sic et Non* is the ancestor of these medieval
  disputations.

## Ibn Rushd (Averroes) (1126–1198)

* Throughout his life Averroeshad to defend philosophy against attacks from
  conservative Muslims. In response to al-Ghazali's *Incoherence of the
  philosophers* he wrote a book called *Incoherence of the incoherence*,
  defending the right of human reason to investigate matters of theology. He
  also wrote a treatise, *The harmony of philosophy and religion*. Is the
  study of philosophy, he asks, allowed or prohibited by Islamic law? His
  answer is that it is prohibited for the simple faithful, but for those
  with the appropriate intellectual power (MK: who is to judge that?), it is
  positively obligatory, provided they keep it to themselves and do not
  communicate it to others (MK: excellent!).
* Averroes' most important contribution to the development of philosophy was
  the series of commentaries—38 in total—that we wrote on the works of
  Aristotle.

## Maimonides (1138–1204)

* *The guide of the perplexed* was designed to reconcile the apparent
  contradictions between philosophy and religion, which troubled educated
  believers. Biblical teaching and philosophical learning complement each
  other, he maintained; true knowledge of philosophy is necessary if one is
  to have full understanding of the Bible. Where the two appear to
  contradict each other, difficulties can be resolved by an allegorical
  interpretation of the sacred text.
* Maimonides' project for reconciling philosophy and religion depends on his
  heavily agnostic view of the nature of theology. We cannot say anything
  positive about God, since he has nothing in common with people like us:
  lacking matter and totally actual, immune from change and devoid of
  qualities, God is infinitely distant from creatures.

## St Bonaventure (1217–1273)

* Franciscian.
* In his writings, Bonaventure, unusually for the Latin middle ages,
  presents himself explicitly as a Platonist. Aristotle's criticisms of
  Plato's Theory of Ideas, he believes, are quite easily refuted.
  Bonaventure did not, however, believe that Ideas existed outside the
  divine mind; they were ‘eternal reasons’, exemplars on which creaturely
  existence was patterned. MK: now what exactly is the difference between
  Ideas that exist in the divine mind and outside of it? What is the mind of
  God?
* Numerology, mistaken mythology around light.
* Bonaventure is familiar with the work of Aristotle, but he engages with
  him principally in order to refute his errors. It was impossible, he
  thought, to accept both that the world was created and that it had existed
  from all eternity: accordingly, he proposed a series of arguments, similar
  to those used by Philoponus and the Kalam theologians, to prove that the
  world had a beginning in time. Bonaventure accepted Aristotle's
  distinction between the agent and the receptive intellect but maintained
  that each of these were faculties of the individual human being. The tasks
  which Aristotle's Arabic commentators had assigned to the unique separate
  agent intellect are performed, in Bonaventure's system, by God's direct
  illumination. Since each human person has an individual intellectual
  capacity, each of us is personally immortal and will be held responsible
  after our death for our deeds in this life.
* Bonaventure accepted Aristotelian hylomorphism and accepted that the human
  soul was the form of the human body. He uses this as an argument against
  Arabic monopsychism: ‘since human bodies are distinct, the rational souls
  that inform those bodies will also be distinct.’ Unlike Aristotle,
  however, and like Ibn Gabirol, he applies the structure of hylomorphism to
  the soul itself. Everything other than God is composed of matter and form.
  Because Bonaventure accepted that the soul contained matter, he was able
  to reconcile the survival of individual disembodied souls with the
  commonly accepted thesis that matter was the principle of individuation.

## Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

* Dominican.
* Reconciled the teachings of Aristotle with Christianity.
* Many books of comments on Aristotle.
* *Summa contra Gentiles* (most frequently in English: *On the Truth of the
  Catholic Faith*) was a missionary manual, written at the request of the
  Spanish Dominican Raymond of Penafort, who was evangelizing non-Christians
  in Spain and North Africa.

  ‘Muslims and pagans do not agree with us in accepting the authority of any
  Scripture we might use in refuting them, in the way in which we can
  dispute against Jews by appeal to the Old Testament and against heretics
  by appeal to the New. These people accept neither. Hence we must have
  recourse to natural reason, to which all men are forced to assent.’

  Thus, the text is not a work of revealed theology, but of natural
  theology, which is a branch of philosophy.
* *Summa theologiae* is Aquinas' magnum opus. It is divided into questions
  and articles, not into chapters. Arguments for and against a particular
  thesis that introduce a genuine disputation are replaced by an
  introductory set (usually a triad) of difficulties against the position
  that Aquinas intends to take up in the body of the article. This initial
  section is the *Videtur quod non* (‘It seems not’). These objections are
  followed by a single consideration on the other side—usually the citation
  of an authoritative text—beginning with the words ‘Sed contra’ (‘On the
  other hand’). After this, in the main body of the article, Aquinas sets
  out his own position with the reasons that support it. Each article
  concludes with the solution of the difficulties set out in the
  introductory objections.

  The method, while initially puzzling to a modern reader, provides a
  powerful intellectual discipline to prevent a philosopher from taking
  things for granted. By adopting it, St Thomas imposed on himself the
  question ‘Whom have I got to convince of what, and what are the strongest
  things that can be said on the other side?’

## Roger Bacon (1220–1292)

* Roger Bacon is often considered a precursor of his 17th century namesake
  Francis Bacon in his emphasis on the role of experiment in philosophy. In
  his main work, the *opus maius*, Roger, like Francis, attacks the sources
  of error: deference to authority, blind habit, popular prejudice, and
  pretense to superior wisdom. There are two essential preliminaries, he
  says, to scientific research. One is a serious study of the languages of
  the ancients—the current Latin translations of Aristotle and the Bible are
  seriously defective. The other is a real knowledge of mathematics, without
  which no progress can be made in sciences like astronomy.

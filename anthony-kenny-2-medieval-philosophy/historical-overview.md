## Augustine of Hippo (13 November 354–28 August 430)

* *Contra Academicos* seeks to sift the true from the false in skepticism.
* *Confessions*—a playful dialogue with God tracing the course of his life
  from childhood to conversion.
* *On the Trinity*—an analysis of biblical and ecclesiastical texts
  concerning the mystery of three persons in one God.
* The most massive and most laborious of Augustine's works was *The City of
  God*, on which he worked from 413 to 426. Though dependent on the Bible on
  almost every page, *The City of God* deserves a significant place in the
  history of philosophy, for two reasons. In the first place, Augustine
  constantly strives to place his religious world-view into the
  philosophical tradition of Greece and Rome: where possible he tries to
  harmonize the Bible with Plato and Cicero; where this is not possible he
  feels obliged to recite and refute philosophical anti-Christian arguments.
  Secondly, the narrative Augustine constructed out of biblical and
  classical elements provided the framework for philosophical discussion in
  the Latin world up to and beyond the Renaissance and the Reformation.

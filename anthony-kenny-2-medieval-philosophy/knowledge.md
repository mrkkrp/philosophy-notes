# Knowledge

## Augustine on scepticism, faith, and knowledge

* The first of the philosophical treatises that Augustine wrote at
  Cassiciacum was *Contra Academicos*, in which he defended the possibility
  of attaining knowledge of various kinds. We know logical truths, such as
  the principle of excluded middle. We also know truths about immediate
  appearance.
* One of his fullest defenses of the possibility of certainty occurs in a
  late work, *De Trinitate* (‘On the Trinity’). Here he is prepared to admit
  that the senses can be deceived. ‘But I cannot be deceived when I say “I
  am alive”—a judgment not of the senses, but of the mind. “Perhaps you are
  dreaming.” But even if I am asleep, I am alive. “Perhaps you are insane.”
  But even if I am insane I am alive. Skeptics may babble against the things
  that mind perceives through the senses, but not against those that it
  perceives independently. “I know that I am alive” is an instance of the
  second kind.’
* Mature Augustine accepts the truth of many propositions besides the
  Cartesian certainties. We should not doubt the truth of what we have
  perceived through sense; it is through them that we have learnt about the
  heavens and the earth and their contents. A vast amount of information is
  derived from the testimony of others—the existence of the ocean, and of
  distant lands; the lives of the heroes of history and even our own
  birthplace and parentage. MK: all of which may be false, this is really a
  lazy argument since it does not allow us to distinguish which things we
  should trust in this way and which we should doubt.
* Throughout his life Augustine gave a place of honor to the truth of
  mathematics, which he classes as ‘inward rules of truth’. Whence and how
  do we acquire our knowledge of mathematics? Early in life Augustine was
  tempted by Plato's explanation that such knowledge is recollection of
  something we learned in a previous life, but in his mature writings he
  cools to the idea that the soul pre-existed the formation of the body.
  Even if there were such a previous life, it would not explain the learning
  of geometry, because we can hardly suppose that every one of us was a
  geometer in a previous life. MK: now, that's a really shallow
  interpretation of Plato. Besides, why doesn't Augustine apply the same
  kind of critical analysis to his own arguments?
* Instead, Augustine is inclined to believe in eternal ideas that exist in
  the mind of the creator. ‘If creation was a work of intelligence, it must
  have been in accord with eternal reasons. But it is blasphemous to think
  that God, in creating the world in accordance with Ideas, looked up to
  anything outside himself. Hence, the unique, eternal, unchanging Ideas
  have their existence in the unique, eternal, unchanging Mind of God.’

## Augustine on divine illumination

* Human beings acquire their own ideas not by recollection (as Plato
  thought) nor by abstraction (as Aristotle thought) but by divine
  illumination. ‘Illuminated by God with intelligible light, the soul sees,
  by means not of bodily eyes but of the intellect which is its crowning
  excellence, the reasons whose vision constitutes its ultimate bliss.’
* Divine illumination seems to be only a metaphor in Augustine, and not the
  best one.

## Bonaventure on illumination

* Nothing more than reflection on what is already in our minds is needed to
  produce an explicit awareness of God's existence.
* For Bonaventure, the inborn notion of God was a special case. He did not
  believe, in general, that our ideas were innate; he agreed with Aristotle
  that the mind was initially a tabula rasa, and that even the most general
  intellectual principles were only acquired subsequent to sense-experience.
  The notion of God was, uniquely, innate because the mind itself was an
  image of God, a mirror in which God's features could be dimly seen.
  Somewhere between the inborn knowledge of God and the acquired knowledge
  of intellectual principles stands our knowledge of virtue: not an innate
  idea nor an abstraction from the senses, but a natural capacity to tell
  right from wrong.

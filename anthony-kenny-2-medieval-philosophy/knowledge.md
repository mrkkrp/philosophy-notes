# Knowledge

## Augustine on scepticism, faith, and knowledge

* The first of the philosophical treatises that Augustine wrote at
  Cassiciacum was *Contra Academicos*, in which he defended the possibility
  of attaining knowledge of various kinds. We know logical truths, such as
  the principle of excluded middle. We also know truths about immediate
  appearance.
* One of his fullest defenses of the possibility of certainty occurs in a
  late work, *De Trinitate* (‘On the Trinity’). Here he is prepared to admit
  that the senses can be deceived. ‘But I cannot be deceived when I say “I
  am alive”—a judgment not of the senses, but of the mind. “Perhaps you are
  dreaming.” But even if I am asleep, I am alive. “Perhaps you are insane.”
  But even if I am insane I am alive. Skeptics may babble against the things
  that mind perceives through the senses, but not against those that it
  perceives independently. “I know that I am alive” is an instance of the
  second kind.’
* Mature Augustine accepts the truth of many propositions besides the
  Cartesian certainties. We should not doubt the truth of what we have
  perceived through sense; it is through them that we have learnt about the
  heavens and the earth and their contents. A vast amount of information is
  derived from the testimony of others—the existence of the ocean, and of
  distant lands; the lives of the heroes of history and even our own
  birthplace and parentage. MK: all of which may be false, this is really a
  lazy argument since it does not allow us to distinguish which things we
  should trust in this way and which we should doubt.
* Throughout his life Augustine gave a place of honor to the truth of
  mathematics, which he classes as ‘inward rules of truth’. Whence and how
  do we acquire our knowledge of mathematics? Early in life Augustine was
  tempted by Plato's explanation that such knowledge is recollection of
  something we learned in a previous life, but in his mature writings he
  cools to the idea that the soul pre-existed the formation of the body.
  Even if there were such a previous life, it would not explain the learning
  of geometry, because we can hardly suppose that every one of us was a
  geometer in a previous life. MK: now, that's a really shallow
  interpretation of Plato. Besides, why doesn't Augustine apply the same
  kind of critical analysis to his own arguments?
* Instead, Augustine is inclined to believe in eternal ideas that exist in
  the mind of the creator. ‘If creation was a work of intelligence, it must
  have been in accord with eternal reasons. But it is blasphemous to think
  that God, in creating the world in accordance with Ideas, looked up to
  anything outside himself. Hence, the unique, eternal, unchanging Ideas
  have their existence in the unique, eternal, unchanging Mind of God.’

## Augustine on divine illumination

* Human beings acquire their own ideas not by recollection (as Plato
  thought) nor by abstraction (as Aristotle thought) but by divine
  illumination. ‘Illuminated by God with intelligible light, the soul sees,
  by means not of bodily eyes but of the intellect which is its crowning
  excellence, the reasons whose vision constitutes its ultimate bliss.’
* Divine illumination seems to be only a metaphor in Augustine, and not the
  best one.

## Bonaventure on illumination

* Nothing more than reflection on what is already in our minds is needed to
  produce an explicit awareness of God's existence.
* For Bonaventure, the inborn notion of God was a special case. He did not
  believe, in general, that our ideas were innate; he agreed with Aristotle
  that the mind was initially a tabula rasa, and that even the most general
  intellectual principles were only acquired subsequent to sense-experience.
  The notion of God was, uniquely, innate because the mind itself was an
  image of God, a mirror in which God's features could be dimly seen.
  Somewhere between the inborn knowledge of God and the acquired knowledge
  of intellectual principles stands our knowledge of virtue: not an innate
  idea nor an abstraction from the senses, but a natural capacity to tell
  right from wrong.

## Aquinas on concept-formation

* There is no doubt that Aquinas is not an empiricist: that is to say, he
  denies that sensory experience is sufficient by itself for intellectual
  thought. In addition to sense-experience, there is needed the action of
  the agent intellect. But if Aquinas is not an empiricist, he is not an
  illuminist either. The agent intellect by itself is insufficient for the
  acquisition of intellectual knowledge. ‘Beside the intellectual light
  within us, there is a need for thinkable species taken from outward
  things, if we are to have knowledge of material things.’ The human
  intellect, in this life, is a faculty for the understanding of material
  objects. Without the senses no object would be given to us; without the
  agent intellect no object would be thinkable. Thoughts without phantasms
  (MK: what are phantasms?) are empty; phantasms without species are
  darkness to the mind.
* The agent intellect is essentially a concept-forming capacity, which
  operates upon phantasms. In turns the potentially thinkable data of
  sense-experience into the actually thinkable species. The formation of
  concepts involves the application of principles such as that of
  non-contradiction: possession of the concept X involves the ability to
  distinguish what is X from what is not X. In that sense the agent
  intellect can be said to be aware of such principles: but of course, by
  itself without any sensory input, such an awareness contributes nothing to
  the knowledge of the essence of material objects which is the intellect's
  proper task in our present life.

## Aquinas on faith, knowledge, and science

* A distinction between truths knowable by natural light, and those
  accessible only by the supernatural light of faith, is one of St. Thomas'
  principal contributions to medieval epistemology. Natural reason is
  capable of reaching a limited number of truths about God. Doctrines such
  as the Trinity and Incarnation are known only be revelation and unprovable
  by unaided reason. Faith, in the theological sense, is belief in something
  on the word of God. Faith is different from the kind of belief in the
  existence of God which a successful philosophical proof would produce. The
  faithful believer takes God's word for many things, but one cannot take
  God's word for it that he exists. Belief in God, in this sense, is not
  part of faith, but is presupposed by it. Thomas calls it a ‘preamble’ of
  faith.
* Truths about God that are reached by natural reason are the province of
  natural theology; the mysteries of faith are the subject of revealed
  theology. ‘Unaided reason’ may mean that in arguing its conclusions,
  natural theology rests only on premises derived from experience or
  reflection, and that it has no need to call in aid any premises derived
  from sacred texts or special revelation. In another sense it may mean that
  the natural theologian reaches his conclusions without the aid of divine
  grace. When we talk about ‘unaided reason’ in the first sense, we are
  talking about the premises from which reason reaches its conclusion, and
  we are talking about logical relationships. On the other hand, when we
  contrast unaided reason with the aid of grace, we have moved from the
  realm of reasons to that of causes: we are talking about the casual, not
  the logical, antecedents of the reasoning process.
* Even those truths that are in principle open to reason must in practice be
  accepted by many people on authority. Establishing them by philosophical
  argument demands more intelligence, leisure, and energy than can be
  expected from the majority of humankind. Thus, there is the distinction
  between the belief of the learned and the beliefs of the simple. The
  simple believer only *beliefs* that there is a God. This belief is not
  faith—it is a belief on human, not divine, authority.
* Aquinas' account of knowledge is heavily influenced by the ideal of a
  deductive science that Aristotle set out in his *Posterior Analytics*.
* With regard to science, we are not meant to understand that the scientist
  starts with self-evident principles and proceeds to conclusions about the
  world by rolling out *a priori* deductions. The procedure goes in the
  opposite direction: the scientist starts with a phenomenon—an eclipse of
  the moon, say—and looks for the cause of it. Finding the cause is the same
  thing as finding the middle term in a syllogism which will have as its
  conclusion the occurrence of the eclipse. The task of science is only
  completed when this syllogism, in turn, is traced back, through other
  syllogisms, to arrive at first principles. But the first principle thus
  arrived at forms the conclusion, not the starting point, of the scientific
  inquiry. The chain of deduction is not the vehicle, but the output, of the
  venture.

## Logic of Boethius

* In the *Isagoge* Porphyry uses a branching strategy to pose three
  questions about species and genera. Species and genera are not individual
  entities like Peter and Paul: they are in some sense universal. Do such
  things, Porphyry asked, exist outside the mind, or are they merely mental?
  If they are outside the mind, are they corporeal or incorporeal? If they
  are incorporeal, do they exist in things perceptible by the senses, or are
  they separate from them? Porphyry left these questions unanswered; but
  they set an agenda for many medieval discussions. They became the
  canonical statement of the Problem of Universals.
* Boethius himself answered these questions thus: they exist outside the
  mind; they are incorporeal; they are not separable except in thought from
  individuals. A species or a genus is a similarity abstracted from
  particulars, as we collect the likeness of humanity from individual
  humans. This, Boethius says, was Aristotle's view; but for purposes of
  formal logic it is not necessary to rule out the Platonic thesis of
  universals existing in separation.
* Boethius wrote on syllogistic reasoning, one on categorical syllogisms and
  one on hypothetical syllogisms. A hypothetical syllogism must contain at
  least one hypothetical premise, that is to say, a proposition constructed
  from categorical propositions by means of the connectives ‘if’, ‘or’, or
  ‘since’. Some hypothetical syllogisms contain categorical premises as well
  as hypothetical ones: one example is the *modus ponens* already familiar
  in Stoic logic:

  > If it is day, the sun is shining; but it is day; therefore the sun is
  > shining.

  Boethius, however, is more interested in syllogisms where all the premises
  and the conclusion too are hypothetical, such as:

  > If it's A, it's B; if it's B it's C; if it's A it's C.

  He elaborates schemata including negative premises as well as affirmative
  ones and premises involving conjectures other than ‘if’, e.g. ‘Either it
  is day or it is night’. Hypothetical syllogisms, he maintains, are
  parasitic on categorical syllogisms, because hypothetical premises have
  categorical premises as their constituents, and they depend on categorical
  syllogisms to establish the truth of their premises.
* Boethius makes an important distinction between two different sorts of
  hypothetical statement. He uses ‘consequentia’ (‘consequence’) as a term
  for a true hypothetical; perhaps the nearest equivalent in modern English
  is ‘implication’. In some consequences there is no connection between the
  antecedent and the consequence: ‘Since fire is hot, the heavens are
  spherical.’ This appears to be an example of what modern logicians have
  called ‘material implication’; Boethius' expression is ‘consequentia
  secundum accidens’. On the other hand, there are consequences where the
  consequent follows necessarily from the antecedent. This class includes
  not only the logical truths that modern logicians would call ‘formal
  implications’ but also hypothetical statements whole truth is discovered
  by scientific inquiry, such as ‘If the earth gets in the way, there is an
  eclipse of the moon.’
* True consequences can be derived, Boethius believes, from a set of supreme
  universal propositions which he call ‘loci’. (MK: axioms?) The kind of
  proposition he has in mind: ‘Things whole definitions are different are
  themselves different.’ MK: well that's not necessarily always true in
  every particular case.

# Logic and language

## Logic of Boethius

* In the *Isagoge* Porphyry uses a branching strategy to pose three
  questions about species and genera. Species and genera are not individual
  entities like Peter and Paul: they are in some sense universal. Do such
  things, Porphyry asked, exist outside the mind, or are they merely mental?
  If they are outside the mind, are they corporeal or incorporeal? If they
  are incorporeal, do they exist in things perceptible by the senses, or are
  they separate from them? Porphyry left these questions unanswered; but
  they set an agenda for many medieval discussions. They became the
  canonical statement of the Problem of Universals.
* Boethius himself answered these questions thus: they exist outside the
  mind; they are incorporeal; they are not separable except in thought from
  individuals. A species or a genus is a similarity abstracted from
  particulars, as we collect the likeness of humanity from individual
  humans. This, Boethius says, was Aristotle's view; but for purposes of
  formal logic it is not necessary to rule out the Platonic thesis of
  universals existing in separation.
* Boethius wrote on syllogistic reasoning, one on categorical syllogisms and
  one on hypothetical syllogisms. A hypothetical syllogism must contain at
  least one hypothetical premise, that is to say, a proposition constructed
  from categorical propositions by means of the connectives ‘if’, ‘or’, or
  ‘since’. Some hypothetical syllogisms contain categorical premises as well
  as hypothetical ones: one example is the *modus ponens* already familiar
  in Stoic logic:

  > If it is day, the sun is shining; but it is day; therefore the sun is
  > shining.

  Boethius, however, is more interested in syllogisms where all the premises
  and the conclusion too are hypothetical, such as:

  > If it's A, it's B; if it's B it's C; if it's A it's C.

  He elaborates schemata including negative premises as well as affirmative
  ones and premises involving conjectures other than ‘if’, e.g. ‘Either it
  is day or it is night’. Hypothetical syllogisms, he maintains, are
  parasitic on categorical syllogisms, because hypothetical premises have
  categorical premises as their constituents, and they depend on categorical
  syllogisms to establish the truth of their premises.
* Boethius makes an important distinction between two different sorts of
  hypothetical statement. He uses ‘consequentia’ (‘consequence’) as a term
  for a true hypothetical; perhaps the nearest equivalent in modern English
  is ‘implication’. In some consequences there is no connection between the
  antecedent and the consequence: ‘Since fire is hot, the heavens are
  spherical.’ This appears to be an example of what modern logicians have
  called ‘material implication’; Boethius' expression is ‘consequentia
  secundum accidens’. On the other hand, there are consequences where the
  consequent follows necessarily from the antecedent. This class includes
  not only the logical truths that modern logicians would call ‘formal
  implications’ but also hypothetical statements whole truth is discovered
  by scientific inquiry, such as ‘If the earth gets in the way, there is an
  eclipse of the moon.’
* True consequences can be derived, Boethius believes, from a set of supreme
  universal propositions which he call ‘loci’. (MK: axioms?) The kind of
  proposition he has in mind: ‘Things whole definitions are different are
  themselves different.’ MK: well that's not necessarily always true in
  every particular case.

## Abelard as logician

* Aristotle had made a distinction between nouns and verbs on the ground
  that the latter, but not the former, contained a time indication. Abelard
  rejects this: it is true that only verbs are tensed, but nouns too contain
  an implicit time-reference. Subject terms stand primarily for things
  existing at the present time: you can see this if you consider a
  proposition such as ‘Socrates was a boy’, uttered when Socrates was old.
  If time belonged only to the tensed verb, this sentence would mean the
  same as ‘A boy was Socrates’; but of course that sentence is false. The
  true corresponding sentence is ‘Something that was a boy is Socrates’.
  This brings out the implicit time-reference in nouns, and this could be
  brought out in a logically perspicuous language by replacing nouns with
  pronouns followed by descriptive phrases: for example, ‘Water is coming
  in’ could be rewritten ‘Something that is water is coming in’.
* The defining characteristic of verbs is not that they are tensed but that
  they make a sentence complete; without them, Abelard says, there is no
  completeness of sense. There can be complete sentences without nouns but
  no complete sentences without verbs. Aristotle had taken the standard form
  of sentence to be of the form ‘S is P’; he was aware that some sentences,
  such as ‘Socrates drinks’, did not contain the copula, but he maintained
  such sentences could always be rewritten in the form ‘Socrates is a
  drinker’. Abelard, on the other hand, takes the noun-verb form as
  canonical, and regards an occurrence of ‘is’ as merely making explicit the
  linking function that is implicit in every verb. We should take ‘…is a
  man’ as a unit, a single verb.
* The verb ‘to be’ can be used not only as a link between subject and
  predicate, but also to indicate existence. The Latin verb ‘est’ (‘is’),
  Abelard says, can appear in a sentence either as attached to a subject (as
  in ‘Socrates est’) or as third extra element (as in ‘Socrates est homo’).
  In the second case the verb does not indicate existence. Any temptation to
  think that it does is removed if we treat an expression like ‘…is
  imaginable’ as a single unit, rather than as composed of a predicate term
  ‘imaginable’ and the weasel word ‘is’.
* Abelard says that in the sentence ‘A father exists’ we should not take ‘A
  father’ as standing for anything; rather, the sentence is equivalent to
  ‘Something is a father’. ‘Exists’ thus disappears altogether as a
  predicate, and is replaced by a quantifier plus a verb.
* On the problem of universals Abelard took a middle way between nominalists
  and realists. One the one hand, he said, it was absurd to say that Adam
  and Peter had nothing in common other than the word ‘human’; the noun
  applied to each of them in virtue of their likeness to each other, which
  was something objective. On the other hand, it is absurd to say that there
  is a substantial entity, the human species, which is present in its
  entirety in each and every individual. A resemblance is not a substantial
  thing like a horse or a cabbage, and only individual things exist.
* Both nominalism and realism depend on an inadequate analysis of what it is
  for a word to signify. Words signify in two ways: they mean things, and
  they express thoughts. They mean things precisely by evoking the
  appropriate thoughts, the concepts under which the mind brings the things
  in the world. (MK: in what sense does the mind bring things in the world?)
  We acquire these concepts by considering mental images, but they are
  something distinct from images. It is these concepts that enable us to
  talk about things and turn vocal sounds into significant words. There is
  no universal *man* distinct from the universal noun ‘man’—that is the
  degree of truth in nominalism. But the noun ‘man’ is not a mere puff of
  breath—it is turned into a universal noun by our understanding.

  Words do signify universals in that they are the expression of universal
  concepts. But they do not mean universals in the way that they mean
  individual things in the world. There are different ways in which words
  mean things. Abelard makes a distinction between what a word signifies and
  what it stands for. The word ‘boy’, wherever it occurs in a sentence, has
  the same signification: you human male. When the word stands in subject
  place in a sentence, as in ‘A boy is running up the road’, it also
  standards for a boy. But in ‘This old man was once a boy’, where it occurs
  as part of the predicate, it does not stand for anything. Roughly
  speaking, ‘boy’ stands for something in a given context only if it makes
  sense to ask ‘Which boy?’
* We can ask not just what individual words signify, but also what whole
  sentences signify. Abelard defines a proposition as ‘an utterance
  signifying truth or falsehood’. Once again, ‘signify’ has a double sense.
  A true sentence *expresses* a true thought; and it *states* what is in
  fact the case. It is the second sense of ‘signification’ that is important
  when we are doing logic; for we are interested in what states of affairs
  follow from other states of affairs, rather than in the sequence of
  thoughts in anybody's mind. The enunciation of the state of affairs that a
  proposition states to be the case is called by Abelard the *dictum* of the
  proposition. A *dictum* is not a fact in the world, because it is
  something that is true or false: it is true if the relevant state of
  affairs obtains in the world; otherwise it is false. What is a fact is the
  obtaining (or not, as the case may be) of the state of affairs in
  question.
* Abelard made a clear distinction between predication and assertion. A
  subject and predicate may be put together without any assertion or
  statement being made.
* Abelard does not restrict inferences to syllogisms: he is interested in a
  mor general notion of logical consequence. He does not use the Latin word
  ‘consequentia’ for this: in common with other authors he uses that word to
  mean ‘conditional proposition’— a sentence of the form ‘If p then q’. The
  word he uses is ‘consecutio’, which we can translate as ‘entailment’. The
  two notions are related but not identical. When ‘If p then q’ is a logical
  truth, then p entails q, and q follows from p; but ‘If p then q’ is very
  often true without p entailing q (MK: how? is this supposed to be
  something obvious or is it explained in the next paragraph?).

  For p to entail q it is essential that ‘If p then q’ be a necessary truth;
  but for Abelard this is not sufficient. ‘If Socrates is a stone, then he
  is a donkey’ is a necessary truth: it is impossible for Socrates to be a
  stone, and so impossible that he should be a stone without being a donkey.
  Abelard demands not just that ‘If p then q’ be a necessary truth, but that
  its necessity should derive from the content of the antecedent and the
  consequent. ‘Inference consists in a necessity of entailment: namely, that
  what is meant by the consequence is determined by the sense of the
  antecedent’. But the necessity of entailment does not demand the existence
  of the things that antecedent and consequent are talking about: ‘If x is a
  rose, x is a flower’ remains true whether or not there are any roses left
  in the world. It is the *dicta* that carry the entailments, and *dicta*
  are neither thoughts in our heads nor things in the world like roses.
* In modal logic Abelard's most helpful contribution was a distinction
  between two different ways of predicating possibility. Consider a
  proposition such as ‘It is possible for the king not to be king’. If we
  take this as saying that ‘The king is not the king’ is possibly true, then
  the proposition is obviously false. Predication is this way Abelard calls
  predication *de sensu* or *per compositionem*. We can take the proposition
  in a different way, as meaning that the king may be deposed; and so taken
  it may very well be true. Abelard calls this the sense *de re* or *per
  divisionem*. Later generations of philosophers were to find this
  distinction useful in various contexts; they usually contrasted
  predication *de re* not with predication *de sensu* but with predication
  *de dicto* (MK: which is what?).

## The thirteenth-century logic of terms

* Terms include not only words, written or spoken, but also the mental
  counterparts of these, however these are to be identified. In practice
  concepts are identified by the words that express them, so the medieval
  study of terms was essentially the study of the meanings of individual
  words. In the course of this study logicians developed an elaborate
  terminology.
* The most general word for ‘meaning’ was ‘significatio’, but not every word
  that was not meaningless had signification. Words were divided into two
  classes according to whether they had signification on their own (e.g.
  nouns) or whether they only signified in conjunction with other,
  significant, words. The former class were called categorematic terms, the
  latter were called syncategorematic. Conjunctions, adverbs, and
  prepositions were examples of syncategorematic terms, as were words such
  as ‘only’ in ‘Only Socrates is running’. Categorametic words give a
  sentence its content; syncategorematic words are function words that
  exhibit the structure of sentences and the form of arguments.
* As a first approximation one can say that the signification of a word is
  its dictionary meaning. Categorical terms, in addition to signification,
  could have a number of other semantic properties, depending on the way the
  words were used in particular contexts. There properties were grouped by
  medieval logicians under the general heading of ‘suppositio’.
* The most basic kind of supposition is called by Peter of Spain ‘natural
  supposition’: this is the capacity that a significant general term has to
  supposit for (i.e. stand for) any item to which the term applies. The way
  in which this capacity is exercised in different contexts gives rise to
  different forms of supposition. (MK: so it the case that natural
  supposition encompasses all other kinds of supposition?)
* One important initial distinction is between simple supposition and
  personal supposition. In ‘Man is mortal’ there is no article and the word
  has simple supposition; in ‘A man is knocking at the door’ the word has
  personal supposition. Personal supposition itself comes in different
  kinds, namely, discrete, determinate, distributive (confused and
  distributive), and confused (merely confused).
* In ‘The dog has just been sick’ the word ‘dog’ has discrete supposition:
  the predicate attaches to a definite single one of the items to which the
  word applies. This kind of supposition attaches to proper names,
  demonstratives, and definite descriptions.
* Determinate supposition is exemplified in ‘A dog is scratching at the
  door’: the predicate attaches to some one thing to which the word applies,
  a thing that is not further specified.
* In ‘A dog has four legs’ (or ‘Every dog has four legs’) the supposition is
  distribute (confused and distribute): the predicate attaches to everything
  to which the word ‘dog’ applies (MK: what's the difference between this
  and simple supposition?). To distinguish determinate from distributive
  supposition one should ask whether the question ‘Which dog?’ makes sense
  or not.
* A word can have personal supposition not only when it occurs in a subject
  place, but also if it appears as a predicate. In ‘Buffy is a dog’ the name
  ‘confused’ (merely confused) was given to the supposition of the word
  ‘dog’. In confused supposition, as in distributive supposition, it makes
  no sense to ask ‘Which dog?’
* All these kinds of supposition (simple supposition and the various form of
  personal supposition)—are examples of ‘formal supposition’. Formal
  supposition contrasts with material supposition, and the underlying idea
  is that the sound of a word is its matter, while its meaning is its form.
  (MK: is matter still the principle of individualization in this case?)
  ‘“Dog” is a monosyllable’ would be an instance of material supposition.
  This is, in effect, the use of a word to refer to itself, to talk about
  its symbolic properties rather than about what it means or stands for.
* Another property of terms is appellation. It is connected with the scope
  of terms and sentences. Consider the sentence ‘Dinosaurs have long tails’.
  Is this true, now that there are no dinosaurs? If we take the view that a
  sentence is made true or false on the basis of the current contents of the
  universe, then it seems that the sentence cannot be true; and we cannot
  remedy this problems simply by changing the tense of the verb to ‘had’. If
  we wish to regard the sentence as true, we shall have to regard truth as
  something to be determined on the basis of all the contents of the
  universe, past, present, and future. The medievals posed this problem as
  being one about the appellation of the term ‘dinosaur’.

## Propositions and syllogisms

* Thomas Aquinas: ‘If we consider what takes place in the mind by itself
  then there is always combination where there is truth and falsehood; for
  the mind cannot produce anything true or false unless it combines one
  simple concept with another. But if the relation to reality is taken into
  account, then the mind's operation is called sometimes “combination” and
  “sometimes” division: “combination” where the mind so places one concept
  beside another as to represent the combination or identity of the thing of
  which they are the concepts; “division” where it so places one concept
  beside another as to represent that the corresponding realities are
  distinct. We talk in the same way of sentence too: an affirmative sentence
  is called “a combination” because it signifier that there is a conjunction
  in reality; a negative sentence is called “a division” because it
  signifies that the realities are separate.’
* What do propositions signify? If we take ‘signify’ as equivalent to
  ‘express’, then it is easy to give an answer: spoken and written
  propositions express thoughts in the mind. But there is then a further
  question: What do mental propositions signify? Here ‘signify’ has to be
  closer to ‘mean’ than to ‘express’. Propositions, it seems, cannot signify
  anything in the world, because a proposition must signify the same whether
  it is true or false; and if the proposition is false, there is nothing in
  the world to correspond to it. The most popular answer to that question in
  the thirteenth century was essentially that given by Abelard: it is the
  state of affairs which, if it obtains, makes the sentence true. Abelard
  called it dictum; others called it an enuntiabile.

## Analogy and univocity

* Aquinas maintained that the words by which we describe God and creatures
  are not used in the same sense about each. Similarly, to adapt one of his
  examples, we do not mean quite the same thing when we call the sun
  ‘bright’ and when we call the color of a patch of paint ‘bright’. On the
  other hand, if we say that God is wise and that Socrates is wise, we are
  not making a pun or talking on metaphor. ‘This way of using words’,
  Aquinas says, ‘lies somewhere between pure equivocation and simple
  univocity, for the word is used neither in the same sense, as with
  univocal usage, nor in totally different senses, as with equivocation.’
* Scotus rejects the idea that there can be a half-way house between
  univocity and equivocation. Certainly, if we are dealing with simple
  concepts that have no constituent parts, there cannot be such a thing as
  the sense of a word being *partly* the same and *partly* different. If the
  terms we apply to God are equivocal—are used in a quite different sense
  from the one they have when applied to creatures—then we cannot draw any
  conclusions about God from the properties of creatures. Any attempt to use
  an analogical predicate as the middle term of a syllogism would be quilty
  of the fallacy of equivocation.
* A concept is univocal, Scotus tells us, when

  it possesses sufficient unity in itself so that to affirm and deny it of
  one and the same thing would be a contradiction. It also has sufficient
  unity to server as the middle term of a syllogism, so that whenever two
  extremes are united by a middle term that is one in this way, we may
  conclude to the union of the two extremes among themselves.
* To show that there can be a universal concept of being that applies both
  to God and to creatures, Scouts argues as follows. If you can be certain
  that S is P while doubting whether S is Q, then P and Q must be different
  concepts (MK: this does not seem completely obvious to me). But you can be
  certain that God is a being, while doubting whether he is an infinite or a
  finite being. Hence the concept of being differs from that of infinite
  being or a finite being. Hence the concept of being is univocal, applying
  to both finite and infinite in the same sense. Concepts like ‘being’,
  ‘good’, ‘one’, and the like are thus, for Scotus, transcendental not just
  in transcending the boundaries of the categories, but also in transcending
  the gap between finite and infinite.
* Scotus does not deny that there are concepts that apply analogously to God
  and creatures. His claim is that these are built upon, and could not exist
  without, more basic concepts that are univocal.
* Perhaps the disagreement between Aquinas, and Scotus is not as sharp as it
  at first appears, because the notions the same sense and the same concept
  are themselves not sharp. Two words have different senses, we might
  suggest, if a dictionary would give two separate definitions of them. But
  when Aquinas says that ‘good’ is an analogous term, he need not be
  suggesting that every different application of ‘good’ creates a new
  lexical item. Different creatures have different good-making properties,
  but that does not mean that the meaning of ‘good’ in ‘good horse’ is
  different from the meaning of ‘good’ in ‘good time’. Indeed, someone who
  did not realize that ‘good’ was, in Aquinas' terms, analogous, would not
  understand its meaning in the language at all. Scotus is right, on the
  other hand, that when we learn to apply ‘good’ to a new object, we do not
  learn a new vocabulary lesson.
* Whether ‘being’ is analogous or univocal is a murky question not because
  of difficulties about analogy but because of the almost universal opacity
  of the medieval notion of *being*. If we are talking about existence, as
  expressed, say, in the sentence ‘There is a God’, then the question
  whether being is an analogous or univocal predicate does not arise since
  attributing existence to something is not a matter of attaching a
  predicate to a subject. But, in Scotus at least, ‘to be’, period, seems
  equivalent to a vast disjunction of predicates: ‘to be a horse, or a
  color, or a day, or …’ and so on ad infinitum. So understood, ‘to be’
  seems clearly univocal. Suppose that there were only three items in the
  universe, A, B, and C. The predicate ‘… is either A, or B, or C’ seems to
  attach in exactly the same sense to each of the three items.

## Ockham's mental language

* A universal is a singular thing, and is universal only by signification,
  being a single sign of many things. There are two kinds of universal:
  natural and conventional. A natural universal is a thought in our mind;
  conventional signs are universal by our voluntary decision, being words
  coined to express these thoughts and to signify many things. The signs in
  our mind are put together to make mental propositions in the same way as
  spoken signs are put together to make a vocal proposition.
* Ockham regarded these mental concepts as forming a language system.
  Besides the spoken, conventional, languages like English and Latin, all
  human beings share a common, natural language. It is from this universal
  language hat regional languages derive their significance.
* Unlike objects of our thoughts, our thoughts themselves are real
  entities—temporary qualities of our souls, items in our psychological
  history. When mental names occur in mental sentences, it is as elements in
  the thinking of the sentence. Ockham does not seem to have made up his
  mind whether they were successive stages in the thinking of the sentence,
  or a set of simultaneous thoughts, or a single complex thought. There is
  good reason for Ockham's hesitation here, because the analogy between
  speech and thought breaks down when we consider temporal duration. Spoken
  words take time to utter, and one word comes out after another. The case
  is the same with mental images of words, as when one recites a poem to
  oneself in imagination. But thoughts are quite different: the whole
  content of a judgment must be present at once if a judgment is to be made
  at all, and there can be no question of the temporal sequence of the
  elements of a thought.
* Ockham's nominalism mean that he has to modify the theory of supposition.
  For Ockham, simple supposition occurs when a word stands for a mental
  entity, as in ‘man is a species’, in which ‘man’ stands for a mental term,
  the only kind of thing that can be a species. This is not a case of
  standing for what it signifies, for the term ‘man’ signifies nothing other
  than individual men. In personal supposition, as in ‘every man is an
  animal’, the word ‘man’ stands for what it signifies, literally every men
  in existence.

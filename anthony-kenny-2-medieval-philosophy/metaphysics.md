# Metaphysics

* Aristotle gives two definitions of first philosophy:
  * the science of divine substance,
  * the science that theorizes about being *qua* being.
* Both definitions coincide. The second describes metaphysics in terms of
  the field it is to explain, namely whatever there is. The first explains
  metaphysics in terms of the principle of explanation it offers: reference
  to the divine unmoved mover.

## Avicenna on being, essence, and existence

* Avicenna accepts the thesis that metaphysics studies being *qua* being,
  but rejects the idea that the object of metaphysics is God. The reason he
  gives is this. No science can demonstrate the existence of its own subject
  matter. But metaphysics, and only metaphysics, demonstrates the existence
  of God. So God cannot be the subject matter of metaphysics.
* According to Avicenna the first ideas that are impressed on the soul are
  *thing*, *being*, and *necessary*; these cannot be explained by any ideas
  that are better known, and to attempt to do so involves a vicious circle.
* Every thing has its own reality which makes it what it is (e.g. a triangle
  has a reality that makes it a triangle, whiteness has a reality that makes
  it whiteness, etc.). This can be called its being, but a more appropriate
  technical term is its ‘quiddity’. This is a better word because ‘being’
  also has the other sense of ‘existence’.
* The most important division between types of being is that between
  necessary being and possible being (there is no such thing as impossible
  being). Possible being is that which, considered in itself, has no
  necessity to be; necessary being is that which, considered in itself, will
  be necessary to be. What is necessary of itself has no cause; what is of
  itself possible has a cause. A being which had a cause would be,
  considered in abstraction from that cause, no longer necessary; hence it
  would not be that which is necessary of itself. MK: but by abstracting in
  this way anything can be converted from necessary being into possible
  being (by removing its cause from consideration). On the other hand, one
  could argue that every being is necessary and is only rendered possible by
  our lack of knowledge about (or intentional abstraction from) the world.
* A concept can be universal in different ways. In can be something that is,
  in actual fact, truly predicated of many things, such as *human*. It may
  be something that it is logically possible to predicate of many things,
  but which in fact is not truly predicated of many things. For example, the
  concept *heptagonal house* is not truly predicated of anything, but there
  is nothing to stop that universal being instantiated many times. The
  concept *sun*, however, is truly predicated of only one thing, and cannot
  be truly predicated of more than one thing; but this impossibility is a
  matter of physics, not of logic. Individuals are quite different. ‘An
  individual is something that cannot be conceived as being predicated of
  more than one thing, like the essence of Zayd here, which cannot be
  conceived as belonging to anything other than himself.’
* > The definition of *horseness* bypasses the definition of *universal*, and
  > universality is not contained in the definition of horseness. Horseness
  > has a definition which has no need of universality; universality is
  > something extra. Horseness is itself nothing but horseness; in itself it
  > is neither one nor many, in itself it does not exist either in perceptible
  > individuals nor in the soul… Horseness is common, in that many things
  > share its definition; but if you take it with particular properties and
  > designated accidents, it is individual. But horseness in itself is nothing
  > but horseness.
* Avicenna is not saying, in Platonic style, that there exists such a thing
  as horseness in itself, apart from any individual horse. Horseness is
  something that occurs in individual horses and we can study it by
  examining it in these individuals. We can also consider the concept as it
  occurs in the mind: as when we say that the concept *horse* is a concept
  easily attained. But we can also consider in the abstract what is involved
  in being a horse, and this is considering horseness in itself.
* Horseness in an individual horse, and humanity in a particular human, will
  be accompanied by ‘particular properties and designated accidents’. For
  Aristotle, it would be these designated accidents—the ones that mark out a
  particular parcel of matter—that would be what individuated Socrates (MK:
  I don't think Aristotle requires any designated accidents in order to
  individuate a parcel of matter). But for Avicenna the humanity in an
  individual human is itself individuated. Though the humanity of Zayd and
  the humanity of Amr do not differ from each other, it is quite wrong to
  think that they are numerically the same: they are not one but two
  humanities.
* For Avicenna, there are individual as well as generic essences. The
  invention of individual essences hold out the possibility of the
  individuation of non-existent entities. For example, coming into being of
  Socrates can be looked upon as the addition of existence to an essence
  that previously lacked it. The pre-existent essence can be regarded as a
  potentiality whose actuality is existence. Thus essence and existence
  appear as a third potentiality-actuality pair alongside matter-form and
  substance-accident. Existence, Avicenna sometimes seems to say, is an
  accident added to essence.
* In the case of a being that is necessary of itself, there is no question
  of having being after non-being, and so the distinction between essence
  and existence does not arise (MK: except the very distinction between
  necessary and possible seems to be dependent on our degree of
  abstraction!). But in all other entities, on Avicenna's view, the two are
  distinct. The significance of the issue depends on whether, in this
  context, ‘essence’ means generic essence or individual essence.
* If we take ‘essence’ in the generic sense, then the distinction between
  existence and essence corresponds to the distinction between the question
  ‘Are there Xs?’ and ‘What are Xs?’ If this is what the distinction amounts
  to, then it is undeniable. But if we take the distinction to be one about
  individual essences, then it seems to entail the possibility of individual
  essences not united to any existence; individual essences of possible, but
  non-existent individuals.
* The postulation of individual essences was a recipe for philosophical
  confusion. Say, an individual is defined (among other things) by what they
  accomplish. Yet, before Noah was conceived, there was not the possibility
  that *he* would build the Ark, but only the possibility that *someone*
  would build an Ark. Avicenna rightly insisted against Plato that there was
  no actualization without individuation—there were no actual universals in
  existence. It was a pity that he did not accept the converse principle
  that there can be no individuation without actualization.

## Aquinas on actuality and potentiality

* The main innovation of Aquinas with respect to metaphysics is his notion
  of *disposition* (*habitus*). It is best approached via the notions of
  *capacity* and *action*. Human beings have many capacities that animals
  lack: the capacity to learn languages, for instance, and the capacity for
  generosity. These capacities are realized in action when particular human
  beings speak particular languages or perform generous actions. But between
  capacity and action there is an intermediate state possible. When we say
  that a man can speak French, we mean neither that he is actually speaking
  French, nor that his speaking French is a mere logical possibility. When
  we call a man generous, we mean more than that he has a capacity for
  generosity in common with the rest of the human race; but we need not mean
  that he is currently doing something generous. Status such as knowing
  French and being generous are dispositions. A disposition is half-way
  between a capacity and an action, between pure potentiality and full
  actuality.
* Not every activity is an exercise of a disposition. God's thought and the
  motion of planets are activities that spring from no dispositions. Natural
  agents need no dispositions in order to perform their natural activities.
  Where capacity and activity are identical as in God, or where capacity can
  be realized only in a single activity, as with the planets and natural
  agents (MK: surely planets do more than a single activity? They move, but
  also they retain their shapes, etc.), there is no room for a third term
  between capacity and activity.
* Dispositions are qualities: they fall into one of the nine Aristotelian
  categories of *accident*. Accidents inhere in substances, and that goes
  also for dispositions. All attributes are attributes of substances, and
  all a person's dispositions are dispositions of a human being. What
  believes, or is generous, or is healthy is, strictly speaking, a man and
  not his mind or his heart or his body. Still, it is not senseless to ask,
  say, whether skill in writing history is principally a gift of memory or
  of imagination. To ask whether something is a disposition of mind or of
  body is to ask whether it belongs to human being *qua* intelligent being
  or *qua* animal of a particular constitution.
* No human activity issues from a purely bodily disposition. Bodily
  activities are either subject to voluntary control or they are not. If
  they are not, then they are natural activities and as such need no
  disposition to account for them. If they are, then the dispositions that
  account for them must be located primarily in the soul. Thus, for Aquinas,
  the ability to run a marathon is a disposition of the soul no less than
  the ability to read Hebrew.
* The most important way in which Aquinas, for better or worse, amplifier
  the Aristotelian system of potentiality and actuality is by applying it to
  the pair of concepts *essence* and *existence*, which he took over from
  Avicenna.
* It is not easy to work out what, for Aquinas, is the relation between
  individual essences and individual existence. Is there a real distinction
  between Peter's existence and Peter's essence—or between either of these
  and Peter himself? While it is true that any creature's existence persists
  for exactly the same length of time as its essence, there is this
  difference, that its existence at one time does not have consequences for
  its existence at a later time in the way that its essence at one time may
  have consequences for its existence at a later time. (MK: is that true? In
  the simplest case, if something ceases to exist at a moment M1 it will
  surely have consequences for its existence at a later moment M2.
  Furthermore, are essences mutable in time?) A human being tends to go on
  living for a certain time; a radioactive elements tends to go out of
  existence at a certain rate. These tendencies are part of the relevant
  essences: it is because of the kind of thing they are that these creatures
  tend to continue or to cease to exist. Essence, therefore, would be
  distinct from existence, as a cause—a formal cause, in this case—is
  distinct from its effect.

## The metaphysics of Duns Scotus

* In Scotus as in Aquinas it is a principal concern of metaphysics to
  establish the existence and attributes of God, so that natural theology is
  a branch of the discipline. But for Scotus the scope of natural theology,
  and therefore of metaphysics, is both broader and narrower than it is for
  Aquinas. It is broader, because Scotus believed that the terms that
  signify the fundamental properties of being *qua* being—such as ‘good’,
  ‘true’, ‘one’, and so on—applied not just analogously, but univocally to
  God as well as to creatures. But it is narrower, because many truths about
  God that Aquinas had treated as accessible to natural reason are regarded
  by Scotus as graspable only by faith.
* Scotus drew up a list of pairs of terms of which one or other must apply
  to whatever there is: every being must be either actual or potential,
  finite or infinite, necessary or contingent. ‘Necessary’ is not a term
  that applies to every being: but the disjunction ‘necessary or contingent’
  does apply, right across the board.
* It is contingent that I am sitting down, because it is possible for me to
  stand up—a possibility that I can exemplify by standing up at the very
  next moment. Scotus, like other scholastics, accepted such a possibility:
  but he went further and claimed that at the very moment when I am sitting
  down there exists a possibility of my standing up at that same moment.
  This involves a new, more radical, form of contingency, which has been
  aptly named ‘synchronic contingency’.
* Scotus makes a distinction between ‘moments of time’ and ‘moments of
  nature’. At a single moment of time there can be more than one moment of
  nature. Moments of nature are synchronic possibilities.
* Synchronic possibilities are note merely logical but also nomological
  possibilities. They need not be compatible with each other, they are
  possible, a modern philosopher might say, in different possible worlds,
  not in the same possible world.
* For Scotus, unlike Aristotle or Aquinas, but like Avicenna, non-existent
  items can possess a potentiality to exist: a potentiality that Scotus
  calls *objective* potentiality, to contrast it with the Aristotelian
  potentiality, which he calls subjective potentiality.
* > There are two ways in which something can be called a being in
  > potentiality. In one way it is the terminus of a power, that to which the
  > power is directed—and this is called being in potentiality objectively.
  > Thus Antichrist is now said to be in potentiality, and other things can be
  > said to be in potentiality such a whiteness that is to be brought into
  > existence. In the other way something is said to be in potentiality as the
  > subject of the power, or that in which the power inheres. In that way
  > something is said to be in potentiality subjectively, because it is in
  > potentiality to something but is not yet perfected by it (like a surface
  > that is to be whitened).
* Non-existent items are individuated by their objective potentiality:
  non-existent A differs from non-existent B because if and when they do
  exist A and B differ from each other.
* Scotus rejects both the notion of matter lacking properties and the thesis
  that matter is the principle of individuation. Matter, according to him,
  has properties such as quantity, and further, prior to such properties, it
  has an essence of its own, even if it is virtually impossible for human
  beings to know what this essence is. Matter, indeed, can exist without any
  form at all. Matter and form are really distinct, and it is well within
  the power of God to create and conserve both immaterial form and formless
  matter, each of them individuated in their own right.
* Actual material substances are composed of both matter and form: here
  Scotus agrees with Aristotle and Aquinas. Scotus gives a novel account,
  however, of the way in which the individual substance and its matter and
  form are themselves individuated.
* What individuates Socrates is neither his matter nor his form but a third
  thing, which is sometimes called his haecceitas, or *thisness*. In each
  thing, there is an *entitas individualis*. ‘This entity is neither matter
  nor form nor the composite thing, in so far as any of these is a nature;
  but it is the ultimate reality of the being which is matter or form or a
  composite thing.’
* How do all these items—matter, forms, haecceity—fit together in the
  concrete material substance? Scotus seems to have no good answer, he
  simply adds the relationship between them as yet another part, but then
  even that part is distinct from all others. How are these different
  entities—the whole and its several parts—distinguished from each other?
  Scotus maintains that there is a real distinction between the substance
  and its matter and form and the relationship between them. By saying that
  these items are really distinct he means that it is at least logically
  possible for any of them to exist without any of the others. He adds that
  if we say that the essence or quiddity of a substance equals its matter
  plus its form, we must say that the essence, no less than the substance
  itself, is really distinct from its components.
* What is the relation between the essence and the haecceity—are these, too,
  really distinct from each other? In an individual such as Socrates we
  have, according to Scotus, both a common human nature and an individuating
  principle. The human nature is a real thing that is common to both
  Socrates and Plato; if it were not real, Socrates would not be like Plato.
  Equally, the individuating principle must be a real thing, otherwise
  Socrates and Plato would be identical. The nature and the individuating
  principle must be united to each other, and neither can exist in reality
  apart from each other. Yet we cannot identify the nature with the
  haecceitas: if the nature of donkey were identical with the thisness of
  the donkey Brownie, then every donkey would be Brownie.
* To solve this enigma Scotus introduces a new complication. Any created
  essence, he says, has two features: replicability and individuality. The
  individuality seems to include an individuating haecceity. However, the
  distinction between the essence and the haecceity is not a real
  distinction (MK: suddenly!), but it is not a mere fiction or creation of
  the mind. It is, Scotus says, a special kind of formal distinction. None
  of this was ever clear to anyone who attempted to study Duns Scotus. One
  of the problems about understanding exactly how Scotus meant his
  distinction to be understood is that the illustrations he gives of its
  meaning, and the contexts in which he applies it, are all themselves drawn
  from areas of great obscurity: the relationships between the different
  divine attributes, and the distinction between the vegetative, sensitive,
  and rational souls in human beings.

## Ockham's reductive programme

* William Ockham was one of the first to reject Scotus' formal distinction
  on the side of reality. ‘Entities are not to be multiplied beyond
  necessity.’ This is the famous Ockham's razor designed to shave off
  philosophers' superfluous woolliness. The remark is not, in fact, to be
  found in his surviving writings. He did say similar things such as ‘it is
  futile to do with many what can be done with few’ and ‘plurality is not to
  be assumed without necessity’, but he was not the first person to make
  such remarks. However, the slogan does sum up his reductionist attitude
  towards the technical philosophical developments of his predecessors.
* Ockham believed neither in common nature nor in the individuating
  principle. All that exists in reality are individuals, and they just are
  individual—they need no extra principle to individuate them. It is not
  individuality, but universality, that needs explaining—indeed, explaining
  away.
* For Ockham's medieval predecessors there were individuals in every
  category—not only individual substances like Socrates and Brownie the
  donkey, but individual accidents of many kinds, such as Brownie's
  whereabouts and Socrates' relationship to Plato. Ockham reduced the ten
  Aristotelian categories to two. Only substances and qualities were real.
  Belief in individuals of other kinds, Ockham maintained, was due to a
  naive assumption that to every word there corresponded an entity in the
  world. Ockham however was not denying the distinction between the
  different categories: what he was denying was that the distinction was
  more than a conceptual one.
* Ockham argued against reality of relations. If a relation were a real
  entity distinct from the terms of the relation, it would be capable of
  existing even if the terms were not. Suppose Socrates is the father of
  Plato, and Plato is the son of Socrates. Then there is a relation of
  paternity between Socrates and Plato. It is absurd to say either that this
  relation could exist without Socrates ever having begotten Plato, or that,
  Socrates having begotten Plato, God could remove from Socrates the
  relation of paternity.
* ‘I do not say that relation is really the same as its foundation; but I
  say that a relation is not the foundation but only an intention or concept
  in the soul, signifying several absolute things.’ Relative terms signify
  the absolute things that are the bearers of the relation, but they are
  connotative terms that signify one term of the relation, connote the
  other, and connote the way in which the two exist. Thus, when we say that
  A is next to B, we are not talking about a real entity of ‘nextness’; we
  are signifying A, connoting B, and saying that there is nothing getting in
  the way between them.
* This, Ockham says, is what natural reason teaches: that there are no such
  entities as relations. But, rather ignominiously, he is prepared to accept
  the existence of such relations in certain cases because he believes that
  certain Christian doctrines—the Trinity, the Incarnation, the
  Eucharist—demand the existence of such relations. This naturally led to
  the suspicion that he was a proponent of a double truth: that something
  could be true in theology that was false in philosophy.

## Wyclif and determinism

* One of the propositions attributed to John Wyclif and condemned at the
  Council of Constance was ‘All things happen by absolute necessity’.
* > Just as no one can prevent the world's having been, so no one can
  > prevent any effect coming to be at the appropriate time. For the
  > following argument is valid: God ordains A; therefore A will necessarily
  > come to pass at the appropriate time. The antecedent is outside any
  > created power and is accordingly altogether unpreventable. Therefore, so
  > is everything which formally follows from it.
* Wyclif's solution to this is to propose that the relationship between the
  divine volition and events in the world is a two-way one: if God's
  volition causes things to happen here below, so, in a sense, events here
  below cause God's volition. The objection that if God's ordaining is
  outside our power, then all that follows from his ordaining is outside our
  power, is answered in a dramatic fashion. Wyclif simply denies the
  antecedent: God's ordaining is not outside our power.

# Metaphysics

* Aristotle gives two definitions of first philosophy:
  * the science of divine substance,
  * the science that theorizes about being *qua* being.
* Both definitions coincide. The second describes metaphysics in terms of
  the field it is to explain, namely whatever there is. The first explains
  metaphysics in terms of the principle of explanation it offers: reference
  to the divine unmoved mover.

## Avicenna on being, essence, and existence

* Avicenna accepts the thesis that metaphysics studies being *qua* being,
  but rejects the idea that the object of metaphysics is God. The reason he
  gives is this. No science can demonstrate the existence of its own subject
  matter. But metaphysics, and only metaphysics, demonstrates the existence
  of God. So God cannot be the subject matter of metaphysics.
* According to Avicenna the first ideas that are impressed on the soul are
  *thing*, *being*, and *necessary*; these cannot be explained by any ideas
  that are better known, and to attempt to do so involves a vicious circle.
* Every thing has its own reality which makes it what it is (e.g. a triangle
  has a reality that makes it a triangle, whiteness has a reality that makes
  it whiteness, etc.). This can be called its being, but a more appropriate
  technical term is its ‘quiddity’. This is a better word because ‘being’
  also has the other sense of ‘existence’.
* The most important division between types of being is that between
  necessary being and possible being (there is no such thing as impossible
  being). Possible being is that which, considered in itself, has no
  necessity to be; necessary being is that which, considered in itself, will
  be necessary to be. What is necessary of itself has no cause; what is of
  itself possible has a cause. A being which had a cause would be,
  considered in abstraction from that cause, no longer necessary; hence it
  would not be that which is necessary of itself. MK: but by abstracting in
  this way anything can be converted from necessary being into possible
  being (by removing its cause from consideration). On the other hand, one
  could argue that every being is necessary and is only rendered possible by
  our lack of knowledge about (or intentional abstraction from) the world.
* A concept can be universal in different ways. In can be something that is,
  in actual fact, truly predicated of many things, such as *human*. It may
  be something that it is logically possible to predicate of many things,
  but which in fact is not truly predicated of many things. For example, the
  concept *heptagonal house* is not truly predicated of anything, but there
  is nothing to stop that universal being instantiated many times. The
  concept *sun*, however, is truly predicated of only one thing, and cannot
  be truly predicated of more than one thing; but this impossibility is a
  matter of physics, not of logic. Individuals are quite different. ‘An
  individual is something that cannot be conceived as being predicated of
  more than one thing, like the essence of Zayd here, which cannot be
  conceived as belonging to anything other than himself.’

* Avicenna is not saying, in Platonic style, that there exists such a thing
  as horseness in itself, apart from any individual horse. Horseness is
  something that occurs in individual horses and we can study it by
  examining it in these individuals. We can also consider the concept as it
  occurs in the mind: as when we say that the concept *horse* is a concept
  easily attained. But we can also consider in the abstract what is involved
  in being a horse, and this is considering horseness in itself.
* Horseness in an individual horse, and humanity in a particular human, will
  be accompanied by ‘particular properties and designated accidents’. For
  Aristotle, it would be these designated accidents—the ones that mark out a
  particular parcel of matter—that would be what individuated Socrates (MK:
  I don't think Aristotle requires any designated accidents in order to
  individuate a parcel of matter). But for Avicenna the humanity in an
  individual human is itself individuated. Though the humanity of Zayd and
  the humanity of Amr do not differ from each other, it is quite wrong to
  think that they are numerically the same: they are not one but two
  humanities.
* For Avicenna, there are individual as well as generic essences. The
  invention of individual essences hold out the possibility of the
  individuation of non-existent entities. For example, coming into being of
  Socrates can be looked upon as the addition of existence to an essence
  that previously lacked it. The pre-existent essence can be regarded as a
  potentiality whose actuality is existence. Thus essence and existence
  appear as a third potentiality-actuality pair alongside matter-form and
  substance-accident. Existence, Avicenna sometimes seems to say, is an
  accident added to essence.
* In the case of a being that is necessary of itself, there is no question
  of having being after non-being, and so the distinction between essence
  and existence does not arise (MK: except the very distinction between
  necessary and possible seems to be dependent on our degree of
  abstraction!). But in all other entities, on Avicenna's view, the two are
  distinct. The significance of the issue depends on whether, in this
  context, ‘essence’ means generic essence or individual essence.
* If we take ‘essence’ in the generic sense, then the distinction between
  existence and essence corresponds to the distinction between the question
  ‘Are there Xs?’ and ‘What are Xs?’ If this is what the distinction amounts
  to, then it is undeniable. But if we take the distinction to be one about
  individual essences, then it seems to entail the possibility of individual
  essences not united to any existence; individual essences of possible, but
  non-existent individuals.
* The postulation of individual essences was a recipe for philosophical
  confusion. Say, an individual is defined (among other things) by what they
  accomplish. Yet, before Noah was conceived, there was not the possibility
  that *he* would build the Ark, but only the possibility that *someone*
  would build an Ark. Avicenna rightly insisted against Plato that there was
  no actualization without individuation—there were no actual universals in
  existence. It was a pity that he did not accept the converse principle
  that there can be no individuation without actualization.

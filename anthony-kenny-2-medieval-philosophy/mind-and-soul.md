# Mind and soul

* Philosophers of mind, throughout history, can be grouped into two main
  classes, introvert and extrovert. Introvert philosophers believe that the
  way to understand the nature of the human mind is to look within oneself
  and to pay close attention to the phenomena of introspective
  consciousness. Extrovert philosophers start from the observable behavior
  of human beings and inquire into the criteria by which we ascribe to
  others mental capacities, states, and activities. In the second millennium
  we could point to Descartes and Hume as paradigms of the introvert school,
  and Aquinas and Wittgenstein as illustrating, in different degrees, the
  extrovert approach. Extroverts look, in the ancient world, to Aristotle as
  their champion; the introvert school can claim Augustine as its founding
  father, and to this day one of its most eloquent members.

## Augustine on the inner life

* A. distinguishes ‘inward man’ and ‘outward man’. This is not to be
  confused with the distinction between soul and body. Not only the body,
  but certain aspects of our soul, belong to the outward man, namely,
  whatever we have in common with dumb animals, such as the senses and the
  sensory memory. The inward man is our better part: the mind, whole tasks
  include recollection and imagination, as well as rational judgment and
  intellectual contemplation.
* The outward man perceives bodies with the five senses. A. takes vision as
  the paradigm sense. When we see something there are three things to be
  taken into consideration: the object seen, the seeing of the object, and a
  third item that A. calls ‘intentio animi’, namely, our mental focus on the
  object. This third element is something proper to the mind alone—sight is
  called a sense of the body only because the eyes are part of the body. The
  mental element can remain, as a striving to see, when vision itself is not
  possible.
* The image or ‘impressed form’ obtained through perception is different
  from the body perceived, even though A. claims that the impressed form ‘is
  so closely united with the species of the thing which we saw that it could
  not be discerned at all’. It is a matter of debate among commentators
  whether this thesis commits Augustine to a representational theory of
  sense-perception. MK: in my opinion yes it does, Anthony Kenny disagrees.
* Among the objects of the outer senses, A. makes the usual distinction
  between those that can be perceived by one sense only (e.g. color and
  sound) and those that can be perceived by more than one sense (e.g. size
  and shape). Besides the five outward senses, A. believes that there is an
  inner sense. In the case of animals, the sense of sight is different from
  the sense to shun or to seek what is seen, and so with the other senses,
  whose objects are sometimes accepted with pleasure and sometimes shunned
  with disgust. This sense cannot be identified with any one of the five
  senses, but must be some other sense that presides over all the other
  senses. MK: but how is this inner sense even a sense? It seems like a
  feature of behavior, the ability for discrimination, not an ability to
  perceive something. This is the nonsense that you get what you try to
  reduce animals to ‘senses and sense memory’ and deprive them of intellect
  and will of their own.
* A. accords great importance to memory. When he comes to philosophical
  analysis of memory, it is modeled very closely on his account of outer
  vision. Just as when we see there is the object seen, the seeing itself,
  and the mental focus, so, when we remember, there is the memory recalled,
  the actual recalling, and the gaze of thought. The difference between a
  merely dispositional memory (something that we have learned and not
  forgotten) and an episode of remembering is treated by A. as parallel to
  that between an object out of sight and object in full view.
* I can remember only what I have seen; but I can think of many more things.
  A. clearly regards thoughts of the latter kind as inner seeings: he
  insists that what we actually see with our inner eye is derived from our
  memory. A. says that it is impossible to have any idea of a color one has
  never seen, a sound one has never heard, or a flavor one has never tasted.
  MK: agree.

## Augustine: on the will

* Augustine devoted much of *On the trinity* to seeking, in human beings,
  replicas of the divine trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He
  identified many different triads, but the supreme image of God is in the
  trinity of memory, intellect, and will. The memory is the ability to think
  thought of all different kinds; the intellect is the ability to assent to
  theoretical thoughts as true; the will is the ability to consent to
  thoughts as plans of action.
* Philosophical discussion of the will may start by considering it as an
  introspective phenomenon, an item of consciousness that makes the
  difference between voluntary and involuntary actions. Or it may start with
  the observable behavior of agents and ask for external criteria by which
  we distinguish between the voluntary and involuntary actions of others. In
  the ancient world Augustine is the outstanding exponent of the
  introspective approach; Aristotle, on the other hand, had adopted an
  extrovert stance, which has led introvert philosophers to deny that he had
  any concept of the will at all.
* For Augustine as for Aristotle, all fully human choice originates in the
  pursuit of happiness, and for both of them individual decisions are to be
  seen as the selection of means to that end.
* Both Aristotle and Augustine imagine the will, or practical reason, as an
  issuer of commands, and both of them are keenly interested in the
  possibility of disobedience to these commands, in the sinner (Augustine)
  or in the incontinent person (Aristotle). Augustine exploits the analogy
  much more fully. He regards every voluntary motion of the body as an
  obedience to a command of the will; and he is fascinated by the
  possibility of second-order volition, where the will is issuing commands
  to itself.
* Self-conflict in the latter case is only possible because we are
  descendants of Adam, inheriting his sin (MK: religion always furnishes
  easy solutions).
* Aristotle accepted that a man may act against the dictates of the rational
  will, but he envisaged this as happening thought the stress of animal
  passion. But Adam fell into sin in Eden, at a time when he had no
  disordered passions; again, Lucifer and his angels fell into sin, though
  they had no animal bodies. Augustine is led to postulate uncaused acts of
  evil will. However one tries to trace back the cause of an evil action,
  sooner or later one will arrive at a sheer act of evil will.
* Suppose there are two people alike in mind and body, each hitherto
  innocent, and each subjected to the same temptation. One gives in, the
  other does not. What is the cause of the sinner's sin? We cannot say that
  it is the sinner himself: *ex hypothesi* both people were equally good up
  to this point. We have to say that it is a causeless evil choice. Thus
  Augustine expounds what was later to be called ‘contra-casual
  freedom’—which, paradoxically, he combines with a strong version of
  determinism. MK: the extent of confusion religion can inflict upon even a
  strong mind.

## The agent intellect in Islamic thought

* Why an agent intellect is needed? The Aristotelian answer would be that
  the material objects of the world we live in are not, in themselves, fit
  objects for intellectual understanding. The nature and characteristics of
  the objects we see and feel are all embedded in matter: they are
  transitory and not stable, individual and not universal. They are, in
  Aristotelian terms, only potentially thinkable or intelligible, but not
  actually so. To make them actually thinkable, it is required that
  abstraction be made from the corruptible and individuating matter, and
  concepts be created that are actually thinkable objects. That is the
  function of the agent intellect.
* Al-Farabi compares the action of the agent intellect upon the data of
  sensory experience to the action of the sun on colors. Colors, which are
  only potentially visible in the dark, are made actually visible by the
  sunlight. The difficult point—and one that was to be debated for
  centuries—is whether the agent intellect is to be identified with some
  separate, superhuman entity, or whether it should simply be regarded as a
  species-specific faculty that differentiates humans from
  non-language-using animals.

## Avicenna on intellect and imagination

* Let someone imagine himself as wholly created in a single moment, with his
  sight veiled so that he cannot see any external object. Imagine also that
  he is created falling through the air, on in a vacuum, so that he would
  not feel any pressure from the air. Suppose too that his limbs are parted
  from each other so that they neither meet nor touch. Let him reflect
  whether, in such a case, he will affirm his own existence. He will not
  hesitate to affirm that he himself exists, but in so doing he will not be
  affirming the existence of any limb, or external or internal organ such as
  heart or brain, or any external object. He will be affirming the existence
  of himself without ascribing to it any length, breath, or depth. If in
  this state he were able to imagine a hand or some other bodily part, he
  would not imagine it being a part of himself or a condition for his own
  existence. MK: now, can a creature of sufficient intellect and a toolbox
  of necessary concepts be formed in such conditions?
* Avicenna argues that since intellectual thoughts do not have parts (MK: in
  what sense?), they must belong to something that is indivisible and
  incorporeal. MK: a simple invention, there is no argument here.
* For Avicenna, the agent intellect is like a radio station perpetually
  broadcasting, on different wavelengths, all the thoughts that there are.
  The human intellect's movement from potentiality to act is the result of
  its being tuned in on an appropriate wavelength. To explain how a human
  being does the tuning in, Avicenna presents an elaborate theory of
  interior sensation.
* In addition to the five familiar external senses, Avicenna believed that
  we have five internal senses:
  1. the common sense, which collects impressions from the five exterior
     senses;
  2. the retentive imagination, which stores the images thus collected;
  3. the compositive imagination, which deploys these images;
  4. the estimative power, which makes instinctive judgments, e.g. of
     pleasure or danger;
  5. the recollective power, which stores the intuitions of the estimative
     power (MK: why do these intuitions need storing, couldn't they be
     re-created automatically under suitable conditions?).
* While the brain is an appropriate storehouse for the deliveries of outer
  and inner sense, it cannot be regarded as the repository of intellectual
  thoughts. When I am not actually thinking them, the thoughts I think are
  available only outside myself, in the agent intellect; my memory of those
  thoughts, my ability to recall them, is my ability to tune in, at will, to
  the ever-continuing transmission of the agent intellect.
* Avicenna's philosophical psychology is important in the history of
  philosophy because he was the original begetter of many concepts and
  structures that played a part in the systems of more sober philosophers.
  Many others accepted his anatomy of the interior senses; those who
  disagreed with him about the nature of the agent intellect agreed in their
  description of the tasks it was needed to perform. Others, of various
  faiths, have been happy to accept (wittingly or not) his rationalization
  of the delights and sorrows held out by religion in the afterlife.

## The psychology of Averroes

* A. reached the conclusion that neither the agent intellect nor the
  receptive intellect is a faculty of individual human beings. The receptive
  intellect, no less than the agent intellect, is a single, eternal,
  incorporeal substance.
* How then can my thoughts be *my* thoughts if they reside in a superhuman
  intellect? A. replies that thoughts belong to not one, but two, subjects.
  The eternal receptive intellect is one subject: the other is my
  imagination. Each of us possesses our own individual, corporeal,
  imagination, and it is only because of the role played in our thinking by
  this individual imagination that you and I can claim any thoughts as our
  own. MK: how simple.
* At death the soul passes into the universal intelligence like a drop of
  water into the sea.
* One of the first and severest critics of Averroes' philosophy of mind was
  Albert the Great. He insisted that both the receptive intellect and the
  agent intellect were faculties of the individual soul: there were as many
  agent intellects as there were human beings. Otherwise the intellectual
  soul would not be the form of the body and our thoughts would not be our
  own. The role of the human agent intellect is to complete the abstraction
  of a universal concept from the data of sense.
* Albert retains a vestige of the theories of Avicenna and Averroes in that
  he does recognize a direct divine causal influence on human intelligence.
  If the universal concepts and beliefs that are the work of our agent
  intellect are to be retained in the form of knowledge in our receptive
  intellect, there is need of a special light emanating from the uncreated
  agent intellect. Such illumination is especially necessary if we are to
  have knowledge of immaterial objects such as angels and God: here
  phantasms and abstraction are of no help. MK: as if one can claim
  *knowledge* of those things.

## Aquinas on the senses and the intellect

* Aquinas rejected the need for a special divine illumination to explain
  normal human concept-formation and the pursuit of natural science. For him
  the intellect—both the agent intellect and the receptive intellect—are
  faculties of the individual human being, standing at the summit of the
  hierarchy of capacities and abilities that constitute the human soul.
* Aquinas does not identify the mind with consciousness. For him the mind
  was essentially the faculty, or set of faculties, that set off human
  beings from other animals. Dumb animals and human beings can all see and
  hear and feel, but only human beings can think abstract thoughts and make
  rational decisions. It is the possession of intellect and will that set
  them off from animals, and it is these two faculties that essentially
  constitute the mind, the rational soul.
* Aquinas accepted the traditional list of five outer senses. Senses are
  distinguished from each other not by having different organs but by having
  different objects; they are essentially discriminatory powers. Each sense
  has its proper object, but there are also objects common to more than one
  sense, such as shape.
* A sense is a capacity to undergo a special kind of change caused by an
  external object. Normally, when the form of F is received by a material
  object, the object becomes F. That is the standard form of change,
  material change. To the kind of change that takes place when a color is
  seen, Aquinas gives the name ‘intentional’ change. The form of color
  exists intentionally in the eye, or, as he sometimes says, the intention
  (*intentio* or *species*) of color is in the eye.
* An *intentio* is not a representation, even though Aquinas sometimes calls
  it likeness, or *similitudo*, of the object perceived. In Aquinas there
  are no intermediaries between perceiver and perceived. In sensation the
  faculty does not come into contact with a likeness of the object; it
  becomes itself like the object by taking on its form. This is summed up in
  the slogan taken over from Aristotle: the sense-faculty in operation is
  identical with the sense-object in action.
* In addition to five outer sense, Aquinas believed that there were inner
  senses, and took over a list of them from Avicenna: the common sense, the
  memory, the imagination, and a fourth faculty, which in animals is called
  the *vis aestimativa* and in humans the *vis cogitativa*. The *vis
  aestimativa* seems to correspond to the notion of ‘instinct’. Acquinas
  does not succeed in making clear what he regards as the equivalent human
  capacity.
* Many philosophers besides Aquinas have classified memory and imagination
  as inner senses. They have regarded these faculties as senses because they
  saw their function as the production of imagery; they regarded them as
  inner because their activity, unlike that of the outer senses, was not
  controlled by external stimuli (MK: was it not, indirectly but
  nevertheless?). Aquinas, indeed, thought that the inner senses, like the
  outer ones, had organs—organs that were located in different parts of the
  brain.
* It seems to be a mistake to regard imagination as an inner sense.
  * It has no organ in the sense that there is no part of the body which can
    be voluntarily moved so that we can imagine better.
  * It is not possible to be mistaken about what one imagines in the way
    that one can be mistaken about what one sees.
* For Aquinas, the intellect thinks in universals, and a grasp of universals
  is not within the capacity of animals: a universal can neither be sensed
  nor imagined. Nonetheless, Aquinas believed that in human beings the
  operation of sense and imagination was essential both for the acquisition
  and for the exercise of universal concepts. In the present life, he
  maintained, the proper object of the human intellect was the essence or
  quiddity, of material objects; and this, he said, the intellect understood
  by abstraction from phantasms. By ‘phantasms’ Aquinas mean the
  deliverances of sense and imagination, and without them Aquinas thinks
  that intellectual thought is impossible. But he does not believe, as
  empiricist philosophers have believed, that ideas are derived from
  sense-experience by abstraction from, or selective attention to, features
  of that experience. If that were so, then animals no less than humans
  would be able to frame universal concepts (MK: which would be a scandal!),
  whereas Aquinas believed that such conceptualization demanded a
  species-specific human faculty, the agent intellect. On the other hand,
  Aquinas does not believe, as rationalist philosophers have believed, that
  there are individual ideas inborn in every human being. Thu human
  intellect, at birth, is for him a *tabula rasa*.
* Beside the agent intellect, which is the capacity to abstract universal
  ideas from particular sense-experience, there is in humans a receptive
  intellect, which is the storehouse of ideas abstracted from senses and
  beliefs acquired from experience. At birth this storehouse is empty: the
  receptive intellect is the initially blank page on which the agent
  intellect writes. But phantasms are necessary not only for the acquisition
  of concepts but also for their exercise: not only to place ideas in the
  mental storehouse, but also to take them out again and put them to use.
* Acquinas rejected that an object could be individuated by listing the
  totality of its properties, that is to say, by listing the universals
  under which it falls. However long a list we draw up, it is always
  possible that it might apply to more than one individual. Given that the
  intellect thinks in universals, it is therefore impossible for there to be
  purely intellectual knowledge of individuals.
* If I know someone well there will be many descriptions I can give of them;
  but unless I bring in references to particular times and places there may
  be no description that could not in theory be satisfied by someone else.
  Only by pointing, or taking you to see them, or reminding you of an
  occasion when you met, can I make clear to you which person I have in
  mind; and pointing and vision and memory are outside the realm of pure
  intellectual thought.
* The indirect nature of intellectual thought about individuals follows from
  two theses that Aquinas held: first, that matter is the principle of
  individuation, and secondly, that the immediate object of all knowledge is
  form. The senses perceive accidental forms such as color and shape; the
  intellect grasps substantial forms, such as humanity. Both thought and
  sensation are cases of the intentional occurrence of forms; but whereas in
  sensation the forms are individual (the smell of *this rose*), in thought
  the form is universal (the idea of *a rose*).

## Aquinas on the will

* Besides the intellect, in Aquinas' system, the other great power of the
  mind is the will. The intellect is a cognitive power of a specifically
  human kind; the will is an appetitive power of a specifically human kind.
  It is the power to have wants that only the intellect can frame. The will
  is the highest form of appetition, the topmost point on a scale whose
  lower rungs are the teleological tendencies of inanimate bodies (e.g. the
  tendency of fire to rise) and the conscious, but non-rational, desires of
  animals (e.g. the desire of a dog for a bone). Humans share these
  tendencies—*qua* heavy bodies they tend to fall if not supported; *qua*
  animals they want food and sleep—but they also have specifically human
  wants, paradigmatically the desire for happiness and for the means to
  happiness. In humans, moreover, even the animal wants are subject to the
  control of the intellectual part of the soul, the will.
* Voluntary action is action that issues from a rational consideration of
  the action. The minimum of rational consideration seems to be that the
  action should issue from a consideration of it as answering to a certain
  linguistic description—e.g. jumping out of the way when someone shuts ‘Get
  out of my way’. But the kind of case Aquinas is more interested in is when
  we have reasons for action: when the action can be presented as the
  conclusion of a piece of practical reasoning. The reasons for an action
  need not have been consciously rehearsed before action; but if an act is
  to be fully voluntary one should, on request, be able to give
  reasons—which might take the form of showing the goodness of the act
  itself or of showing that it was a means to a desirable end. In calling
  voluntary behavior ‘commanded action’ Aquinas is drawing attention to the
  analogy between the logical relationship between command and execution and
  the relationship of willing to acting.
* One way practical reasoning differs from theoretical reasoning is that it
  is, in the lawyer's jargon, *defeasible*. In theoretical deductive
  reasoning, if a conclusion follows from a given set of premises it follows
  also from any larger set containing those premises: the argument cannot be
  defeated by the addition of an extra premise. But with practical reasoning
  it is different. A pattern of reasoning that would justify a certain
  course of action on the basis of certain wants and beliefs may well cease
  to justify it if further wants and beliefs are brought into consideration.
* When we look at a piece of practical reasoning—reasoning about what to
  do—we find, where analogy with theoretical reasoning would lead us to
  expect necessitation, merely contingent and defeasible connections between
  one step and another. Aquinas believed that this contingency was the
  fundamental ground of human freedom.
* Aquinas believed that the human soul was immaterial and immortal. I omit
  the antiquated argument he provides.
* Prime matter receives individual forms, the intellect receives pure forms.
  If the mind had any matter in it, the ideas it operates with would become
  individual, not universal. This argument, if successful, shows that the
  soul does not contain matter. But does it mean that it exist in separation
  from matter—in separation, for instance, from the body of the person whose
  soul it is? Aquinas believes that it does. Intellectual thought is an
  activity in which the body has no share; but nothing can act on its own
  unless it exists on its own; for only what is actually existent can act,
  and the way it acts depends on the way it exists. ‘Hence we do not say
  that heat heats, but that a hot body heats. So the human soul, which is
  called the intellect or mind, is something non-bodily and subsistent’.
* One problem with this argument is that elsewhere Aquinas insists that just
  as it is strictly incorrect to say that heat heats, so it is strictly
  incorrect to say that the soul, or the mind, thinks. Aristotle had said,
  ‘It is better not to say that the soul pities, or learns, or thinks, but
  that it is the human being that does these things with his soul’, and
  Aquinas echoes this when he says, ‘It can be said that the soul thinks,
  just as the eye sees, but it is better to say that the human being thinks
  with the soul.’ If we take this comparison seriously, we must say that
  just as an eye, outside a body, is not really an eye at all anymore, so a
  soul, separated from a body, is not really a soul any more.
* Aquinas agrees that a person's disembodied soul is not the some thing as
  the person whole soul it is. ‘The soul, since it is part of the body of a
  human being, is not a whole human being, and my soul is not I; so even if
  a soul gains salvation in another life, that is not I or any human being.’
  It is remarkable that Aquinas refuses to identify an individual with an
  individual's soul, as many theologians before him, and many philosophers
  after him, were willing to do.

## Scotus vs Aquinas

* For Scotus there exists an individual element, or *haecceitas*, which is
  an object of knowledge: it is not quite a form, but is sufficiently like a
  form to be present in the intellect. Because each thing has within it a
  formal, intelligible, principle, the ground is cut beneath the basis on
  which Aquinas rested the need for a species-specific agent intellect in
  human beings.
* If proper objects of intellect include not only universals but individual
  items like a *haecceitas*, then there is a possibility of such an object
  being in intellect without existing in reality. This is the possibility
  that Aquinas' intentionality theory was careful to avoid. An individual
  form, for Scotus, may exist in the mind and yet the corresponding
  individual not exist. Hence the individual form present in the intellect
  can be only a representation of, and not identical with, the object whose
  knowledge it embodies. Hence a window is opened at the level of the
  highest intellectual knowledge, a window to permit the entry of the
  epistemological problems that have been familiar to us since Descartes.
* For Scotus, what is contingent must come from an undetermined cause, which
  can only be the will itself, not an indetermination on the part of the
  intellect.
* Scotus' criticism of the idea that the indeterminism of the will arises
  from an indeterminism in the intellect is based on a misunderstanding of
  the theory that he is attacking. The intellect in dictating to the reason
  does not say ‘this will be’ or ‘this will not be’, but rather ‘this is to
  be’ or ‘this is not to be’, ‘this is good’ or ‘this is not good’. If what
  is in question is a non-necessary means to a chosen goal, it is possible
  for the intellect, without error, to dictate both that something is good
  and that its opposite is good. Moreover, in making the will the cause of
  its own freedom, Scotus' theory runs the danger of leading to an infinite
  regress of free choices, where the freedom of a choice depends on a
  previous free choice, whose freedom depends on a previous one, and so on
  forever.
* Scouts is unaware of such difficulties and proceeds to develop an
  elaborate analysis of the structure of human freedom. It seems that his
  account principally rests on the highly esoteric idea of synchronic
  contingency. At any given moment while the will is willing X, it has the
  power to not will X. For Scotus, this is the source of human freedom.

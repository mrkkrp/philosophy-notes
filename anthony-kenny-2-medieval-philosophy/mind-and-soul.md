# Mind and soul

* Philosophers of mind, throughout history, can be grouped into two main
  classes, introvert and extrovert. Introvert philosophers believe that the
  way to understand the nature of the human mind is to look within oneself
  and to pay close attention to the phenomena of introspective
  consciousness. Extrovert philosophers start from the observable behavior
  of human beings and inquire into the criteria by which we ascribe to
  others mental capacities, states, and activities. In the second millennium
  we could point to Descartes and Hume as paradigms of the introvert school,
  and Aquinas and Wittgenstein as illustrating, in different degrees, the
  extrovert approach. Extroverts look, in the ancient world, to Aristotle as
  their champion; the introvert school can claim Augustine as its founding
  father, and to this day one of its most eloquent members.

## Augustine on the inner life

* A. distinguishes ‘inward man’ and ‘outward man’. This is not to be
  confused with the distinction between soul and body. Not only the body,
  but certain aspects of our soul, belong to the outward man, namely,
  whatever we have in common with dumb animals, such as the senses and the
  sensory memory. The inward man is our better part: the mind, whole tasks
  include recollection and imagination, as well as rational judgment and
  intellectual contemplation.
* The outward man perceives bodies with the five senses. A. takes vision as
  the paradigm sense. When we see something there are three things to be
  taken into consideration: the object seen, the seeing of the object, and a
  third item that A. calls ‘intentio animi’, namely, our mental focus on the
  object. This third element is something proper to the mind alone—sight is
  called a sense of the body only because the eyes are part of the body. The
  mental element can remain, as a striving to see, when vision itself is not
  possible.
* The image or ‘impressed form’ obtained through perception is different
  from the body perceived, even though A. claims that the impressed form ‘is
  so closely united with the species of the thing which we saw that it could
  not be discerned at all’. It is a matter of debate among commentators
  whether this thesis commits Augustine to a representational theory of
  sense-perception. MK: in my opinion yes it does, Anthony Kenny disagrees.
* Among the objects of the outer senses, A. makes the usual distinction
  between those that can be perceived by one sense only (e.g. color and
  sound) and those that can be perceived by more than one sense (e.g. size
  and shape). Besides the five outward senses, A. believes that there is an
  inner sense. In the case of animals, the sense of sight is different from
  the sense to shun or to seek what is seen, and so with the other senses,
  whose objects are sometimes accepted with pleasure and sometimes shunned
  with disgust. This sense cannot be identified with any one of the five
  senses, but must be some other sense that presides over all the other
  senses. MK: but how is this inner sense even a sense? It seems like a
  feature of behavior, the ability for discrimination, not an ability to
  perceive something. This is the nonsense that you get what you try to
  reduce animals to ‘senses and sense memory’ and deprive them of intellect
  and will of their own.
* A. accords great importance to memory. When he comes to philosophical
  analysis of memory, it is modeled very closely on his account of outer
  vision. Just as when we see there is the object seen, the seeing itself,
  and the mental focus, so, when we remember, there is the memory recalled,
  the actual recalling, and the gaze of thought. The difference between a
  merely dispositional memory (something that we have learned and not
  forgotten) and an episode of remembering is treated by A. as parallel to
  that between an object out of sight and object in full view.
* I can remember only what I have seen; but I can think of many more things.
  A. clearly regards thoughts of the latter kind as inner seeings: he
  insists that what we actually see with our inner eye is derived from our
  memory. A. says that it is impossible to have any idea of a color one has
  never seen, a sound one has never heard, or a flavor one has never tasted.
  MK: agree.

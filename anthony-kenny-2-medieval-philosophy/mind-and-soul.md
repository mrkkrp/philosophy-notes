# Mind and soul

* Philosophers of mind, throughout history, can be grouped into two main
  classes, introvert and extrovert. Introvert philosophers believe that the
  way to understand the nature of the human mind is to look within oneself
  and to pay close attention to the phenomena of introspective
  consciousness. Extrovert philosophers start from the observable behavior
  of human beings and inquire into the criteria by which we ascribe to
  others mental capacities, states, and activities. In the second millennium
  we could point to Descartes and Hume as paradigms of the introvert school,
  and Aquinas and Wittgenstein as illustrating, in different degrees, the
  extrovert approach. Extroverts look, in the ancient world, to Aristotle as
  their champion; the introvert school can claim Augustine as its founding
  father, and to this day one of its most eloquent members.

## Augustine on the inner life

* A. distinguishes ‘inward man’ and ‘outward man’. This is not to be
  confused with the distinction between soul and body. Not only the body,
  but certain aspects of our soul, belong to the outward man, namely,
  whatever we have in common with dumb animals, such as the senses and the
  sensory memory. The inward man is our better part: the mind, whole tasks
  include recollection and imagination, as well as rational judgment and
  intellectual contemplation.
* The outward man perceives bodies with the five senses. A. takes vision as
  the paradigm sense. When we see something there are three things to be
  taken into consideration: the object seen, the seeing of the object, and a
  third item that A. calls ‘intentio animi’, namely, our mental focus on the
  object. This third element is something proper to the mind alone—sight is
  called a sense of the body only because the eyes are part of the body. The
  mental element can remain, as a striving to see, when vision itself is not
  possible.
* The image or ‘impressed form’ obtained through perception is different
  from the body perceived, even though A. claims that the impressed form ‘is
  so closely united with the species of the thing which we saw that it could
  not be discerned at all’. It is a matter of debate among commentators
  whether this thesis commits Augustine to a representational theory of
  sense-perception. MK: in my opinion yes it does, Anthony Kenny disagrees.
* Among the objects of the outer senses, A. makes the usual distinction
  between those that can be perceived by one sense only (e.g. color and
  sound) and those that can be perceived by more than one sense (e.g. size
  and shape). Besides the five outward senses, A. believes that there is an
  inner sense. In the case of animals, the sense of sight is different from
  the sense to shun or to seek what is seen, and so with the other senses,
  whose objects are sometimes accepted with pleasure and sometimes shunned
  with disgust. This sense cannot be identified with any one of the five
  senses, but must be some other sense that presides over all the other
  senses. MK: but how is this inner sense even a sense? It seems like a
  feature of behavior, the ability for discrimination, not an ability to
  perceive something. This is the nonsense that you get what you try to
  reduce animals to ‘senses and sense memory’ and deprive them of intellect
  and will of their own.
* A. accords great importance to memory. When he comes to philosophical
  analysis of memory, it is modeled very closely on his account of outer
  vision. Just as when we see there is the object seen, the seeing itself,
  and the mental focus, so, when we remember, there is the memory recalled,
  the actual recalling, and the gaze of thought. The difference between a
  merely dispositional memory (something that we have learned and not
  forgotten) and an episode of remembering is treated by A. as parallel to
  that between an object out of sight and object in full view.
* I can remember only what I have seen; but I can think of many more things.
  A. clearly regards thoughts of the latter kind as inner seeings: he
  insists that what we actually see with our inner eye is derived from our
  memory. A. says that it is impossible to have any idea of a color one has
  never seen, a sound one has never heard, or a flavor one has never tasted.
  MK: agree.

## Augustine: on the will

* Augustine devoted much of *On the trinity* to seeking, in human beings,
  replicas of the divine trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He
  identified many different triads, but the supreme image of God is in the
  trinity of memory, intellect, and will. The memory is the ability to think
  thought of all different kinds; the intellect is the ability to assent to
  theoretical thoughts as true; the will is the ability to consent to
  thoughts as plans of action.
* Philosophical discussion of the will may start by considering it as an
  introspective phenomenon, an item of consciousness that makes the
  difference between voluntary and involuntary actions. Or it may start with
  the observable behavior of agents and ask for external criteria by which
  we distinguish between the voluntary and involuntary actions of others. In
  the ancient world Augustine is the outstanding exponent of the
  introspective approach; Aristotle, on the other hand, had adopted an
  extrovert stance, which has led introvert philosophers to deny that he had
  any concept of the will at all.
* For Augustine as for Aristotle, all fully human choice originates in the
  pursuit of happiness, and for both of them individual decisions are to be
  seen as the selection of means to that end.
* Both Aristotle and Augustine imagine the will, or practical reason, as an
  issuer of commands, and both of them are keenly interested in the
  possibility of disobedience to these commands, in the sinner (Augustine)
  or in the incontinent person (Aristotle). Augustine exploits the analogy
  much more fully. He regards every voluntary motion of the body as an
  obedience to a command of the will; and he is fascinated by the
  possibility of second-order volition, where the will is issuing commands
  to itself.
* Self-conflict in the latter case is only possible because we are
  descendants of Adam, inheriting his sin (MK: religion always furnishes
  easy solutions).
* Aristotle accepted that a man may act against the dictates of the rational
  will, but he envisaged this as happening thought the stress of animal
  passion. But Adam fell into sin in Eden, at a time when he had no
  disordered passions; again, Lucifer and his angels fell into sin, though
  they had no animal bodies. Augustine is led to postulate uncaused acts of
  evil will. However one tries to trace back the cause of an evil action,
  sooner or later one will arrive at a sheer act of evil will.
* Suppose there are two people alike in mind and body, each hitherto
  innocent, and each subjected to the same temptation. One gives in, the
  other does not. What is the cause of the sinner's sin? We cannot say that
  it is the sinner himself: *ex hypothesi* both people were equally good up
  to this point. We have to say that it is a causeless evil choice. Thus
  Augustine expounds what was later to be called ‘contra-casual
  freedom’—which, paradoxically, he combines with a strong version of
  determinism. MK: the extent of confusion religion can inflict upon even a
  strong mind.

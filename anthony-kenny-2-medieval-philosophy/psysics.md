# Physics

## Augustine on time

* Q: what was God doing before the world began? If first God was idle and
  then creative, surely that involves a change in the unchangeable one? A:
  Augustine solves this by effectively placing God outside of time. There
  was no “before” because time did not exist.
* Augustine further argues that only present is real, while past and future
  are only in the mind.

## Philoponus, critic of Aristotle

* Philoponus argues that the universe had a beginning. The first part of his
  argument revolves about outdated notions of five elements and their
  motions. The other part of the argument is based on the contradiction with
  Aristotle's own opinion that nothing could traverse through more than a
  finite number of temporal periods.
* P. further attacked the dynamics of natural and violent motion. No need to
  go in depth on these outdated notions. Suffice it to say that P. arrives
  at a notion to which later physicists gave the technical term ‘impetus’.

## Natural philosophy in the thirteenth century

* Aquinas provides argument on both sides of the debate on whether the
  universe had a beginning in the first part of *Summa Theologiae*. In the
  first article he presents ten arguments that purport to show that the
  world (‘the universe of creatures’) has existed forever; in the second
  he presents eight arguments to show that it had a beginning. He offers a
  refutation of each of the arguments on either side, and concludes that
  while the world did have a beginning, that is not something that can be
  proved or scientifically known, but is purely an article of faith.

## Actual and potential infinity

* Those who wished to prove that the world had been created in time often
  argued that belief in an eternal universe entailed belief in an actual
  infinite. Thus Bonaventure argues as follows:

  > It is impossible for any addition to be made to what is infinite. This
  > is clear, because whatever is added to becomes greater, but nothing is
  > greater than the infinite. But if the world had no beginning, it has
  > lasted for infinity; therefore, no addition can be made to its duration.
  > But it is clear that this is false; every day a new solar revolution is
  > added to all the past revolutions. Perhaps you will say that it is
  > infinite with respect to past, but actually finite with respect to the
  > present that now obtains, and it is only with respect to the current,
  > finite, part that one can find something greater. But we can show that
  > with respect to the past a greater can be found. It is an unquestionable
  > truth that if the world is eternal, there have been infinite revolutions
  > of the sun, and moreover that there have been twelve revolutions of the
  > moon for every one of the sun. Hence, the moon has gone round more often
  > than the sun. But the sun has gone round an infinite number of times;
  > therefore it is possible to find something exceeding what is infinite in
  > the very respect in which it is infinite. But this is impossible.
* If there were actual infinities, even if not synchronic, they would be
  countable, in the way that years and months are countable. But if there
  were countable infinities, there would be unequal infinities, and surely
  this was a scandal.
* Some medieval philosophers responded to this scandal by denying that
  ‘equal to’ and ‘greater than’ applied to infinite numbers at all. Others
  accepted that there could be equal and unequal infinities, but denied that
  the axiom ‘the whole is greater than its part’ applied to infinite
  numbers.
* The infinitely divisible continuum, as envisaged by Aristotle, did not
  raise the problem of unequal infinities, because the parts of the
  continuum were only potentially distinct from each other, and potential
  entities were not countable in the same way as actual entities.
* Fourteenth-century logicians and natural philosophers took an interest not
  only in the spatial continuum but in the continua of time and motion. One
  of Richard Kilvington's sophismata (no. 13) sets a problem about
  traversing a distance. When Socrates traverses a distance A, should we say
  that he traverses it at any time he is in the process of traversing, or
  only when he has completed the process? There seems a problem either way.
  If we take the second option, then Socrates is only traversing A when he
  has ceased to do so; if we take the first option, then Socrates traverses
  A infinitely many times, since the motion is infinitely divisible; yet he
  only traverses it once.
* In one way the verb ‘will traverse’ is expounded as follows: ‘Socrates
  will traverse distance A’—that is, ‘Socrates will be in the process of
  traversing distance A’. And in this way the sophisma is true. Moreover,
  the last conclusion—that in this way infinitely often will Socrates
  traverse distance A—is granted; for infinitely often will Socrates be in
  the process of traversing distance A. The sophisma can be expounded in
  another way as follows: ‘Socrates will traverse distance A’—that is,
  ‘Distance A will have been traversed by Socrates’. Speaking in this way,
  before C [the moment of reaching the terminus] Socrates will not traverse
  distance A.
* The method of ‘expounding’ verbs had been popular with logicians since the
  time of Peter of Spain. Favorite ‘exponible’ verbs were ‘begin’ and
  ‘cease’. Kilvington and his colleagues offered to expound such verbs in
  order to deal with such problems as whether there were first and last
  moments of motion. The common answer was that there were not: only a last
  moment before a motion began, and a first moment after motion ceased.
* On one view, change in temperature was to be explained as an admixture of
  heat and cold. Walter Burley introduced the notion of degrees of heat, on
  a single scale which he called a ‘latitude’. Heat and cold were to be
  considered not two qualities, but a single quality. At one end of the
  latitude would be maximum heat, and at the other end maximum cold. He thus
  introduced our modern concept of temperature and laid the foundation for
  important developments in physics.

# Historical overview

## Humanism and reform

* Erasmus, More, and their friends propounded in Northern Europe the
  humanist ideas that had taken root in Italy in the previous century.
  ‘Humanism’ at that time did not mean a desire to replace religious values
  with secular human ones: Erasmus was a priest who wrote best-selling works
  of piety, and More was later martyred for his religious beliefs.
  Humanists, rather, were people who believed in the educational value of
  the ‘humane letters’ (*literae humaniores*) of the Greek and Latin
  classics.
* Humanists valued grammar, philology, and rhetoric more highly than the
  technical philosophical studies that had preoccupied scholars during the
  Middle Ages. They despised the Latin that had been the lingua franca of
  medieval universities.
* Erasmus was more interested in divinity than in philosophy, and he cared
  more for biblical studies than for speculative theology. Scholastics like
  Scotus and Ockham, he complained, merely choked with brambles paths that
  had been made plain by earlier thinkers.
* Luther was an Augustinian monk, as Erasmus had been until released by
  papal dispensation from his monastic commitments. Like Erasmus, Luther had
  made a close study of St Paul's Epistle to the Romans. This had made him
  question fundamentally the ethos of Renaissance Catholicism. The year
  after the publication of Erasmus' New Testament Luther issued, in the
  University of Wittenberg, a public denunciation of abuses of papal
  authority, in particular of a scandalously promoted offer of an indulgence
  in return for contributions to the building of the great new church of St
  Peters' in Rome.
* In 1520 Pope Leo X condemned forty-one articles taken from Luther's
  teaching, and followed this up with an excommunication after Luther had
  burnt the Bull of Condemnation.

## Sin, grace, and freedom

* Adrian VI urged Erasmus to take up his pen against the reformers. The
  ground Erasmus chose for battle was Luther's position on the freedom of
  the will. Philosophically, Erasmus is unsubtle. He refers to, but does not
  improve upon, Valla's dialogue on free will. He repeats commonplaces of
  centuries of scholastic debate which are inadequate responses to the
  problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge with human freedom—he insists,
  for instance, that even humans know many things that will happen in the
  future, such as eclipses of the sun. A theory of free will that leaves us
  no freer than the starts in their courses is not a very robust answer to
  Luther.
* Luther the opinion that the Council of Constance ascribed to Wyclif: that
  everything happens of ‘necessity’. He distinguishes, however, between two
  senses of ‘necessity’. The human will is subject to ‘necessity of
  immutability’: it has no power to change itself from its innate desire for
  evil. But it is not subject to another form of necessity, namely
  compulsion: a human being lacking grace does evil spontaneously and
  willingly. The human will is like a beast of burden: if God rides it, it
  wills and goes where God wills; if Satan rides it, it goes where Satan
  wills. It has no freedom to choose its rider.
* Luther prefers to abandon altogether the term ‘free will’; other writers,
  before and after, have regarded the spontaneity that he accepts as being
  the only thing that can genuinely be meant by the term. Luther's principal
  concern was to deny free will in matters that make the difference between
  salvation and damnation. In other cases he seems to allow the possibility
  of genuine choice between alternative courses of action. Humans have free
  will in respect not of what is above them, but in respect of what is below
  them. The sinner, for instance, can make his choice between a variety of
  sins.
* From a philosophical point of view these early Reformation debates on
  freedom and determinism do no more than rehearse arguments which were
  commonplaces of ancient and medieval philosophy. They illustrate, however,
  the negative side of humanist education. Scholastic debates, if sometimes
  arid, had commonly been sober and courteous. Thomas Aquinas', for
  instance, was always anxious to put the best possible interpretation on
  the theses of those he disagreed with. Erasmus shared something of
  Aquinas' eirenic spirit; but More and Luther attack each other with bitter
  vituperation made only the more vulgar by the elegant Latin in which it is
  phrased. The pugnacious conventions of humanist debate were a factor which
  led to the hardening of positions on either side of the Reformation
  divide.

## Authority and conscience

* Luther introduced a general hostility not just to scholasticism but to
  philosophy itself. He denounced Aristotle, and in particular his *Ethics*,
  as ‘the vilest enemy of grace’. His contempt for the powers of unaided
  reason was the outcome of his belief that in Adam's fall human nature had
  become totally corrupt and impotent.
* Pessimism about the moral capacity of the trained intellect unaided by
  grace went hand in hand with optimism about the intellectual ability of
  the untrained mind illumined by faith. Squeezed between the two,
  philosophy found its role greatly diminished among devout Protestants.
* In Rome Pope Paul III (1534-9) promoted a Counter-Reformation, instituting
  a new religious order of Jesuits, and convening a Council at Tent to
  reform Church discipline. The council condemned the Lutheran doctrine of
  justification by faith alone, and the Calvinist doctrine that God
  predestined the wicked to hell prior to any sin. Free will, it insisted,
  had not been extinguished by Adam's fall. It reaffirmed the doctrine of
  transubstantiation and the traditional seven sacraments. By the time the
  council had finished its work, in 1563, Luther was dead and Calvin was
  dying.

## The decline of logic

* The combined effects of the Renaissance and the Reformation made the
  sixteenth century a barren one in most areas of philosophy. Logic was
  perhaps the branch of philosophy that suffered most severely. Logic did
  continue to be taught in the universities, but humanist scholars were
  impatient of it, regarding its terminology as barbarous and its
  complexities as pettifogging.

## Skepticism, sacred and profane

* Sebastian Castellio wrote *Whether Heretics are to be persecuted* (1554)
  in which he pleaded in favor of toleration. His arguments are mainly
  quotations of authoritative texts or appeals to the example of Christ. In
  a later work, *The art of doubting*, Castellio developed more
  epistemological arguments. The difficulty of interpreting Scripture, and
  the variety of opinions among Christian sects, should make us very
  cautious in laying down the law on religious matters. To be sure, there
  are some truths that are beyond doubt, such as the existence and goodness
  of God; but on other religious topics no one can be sufficiently certain
  so as to be justified in killing another man as a heretic. Castellio, in
  his time, was a lone voice; but later supporters of toleration looked back
  to him as a forerunner.
* *Apology for Raimond Sebond* (1569) by Michel Eyquem de Montaigne became
  the classic modern statement of skepticism. The *Apology* contains much
  more than a rehearsal of ancient skeptical arguments. Prior to presenting
  them, Montaigne works hard to induce in his reader a proper degree of
  intellectual humility. He argues that animals, no less than humans, have
  feelings, thoughts, and virtues. The two spheres in which above all humans
  plume themselves on their unique gifts are religion and philosophy.
  Montaigne shows that humans can take little pride in their theological
  beliefs and activities, given the variety of contradictory doctrines on
  offer, and given the often debasing nature of religious practices. As for
  philosophy, he has no difficulty at all in showing that there has never
  been a philosopher whose system has been able to withstand the criticism
  of other philosophers.
* Montaigne's deflation of human nature in *Raimond Sebond* is the
  antithesis of the glorification of mankind in Pico della Mirondola's 1486
  *On the dignity of man*. The optimism generated by the rediscovery of
  classical texts and the exuberance of the visual arts in Renaissance
  Florence gave way to the pessimism natural in a Counter-Reformation France
  torn by sectarian warfare.
* To reconcile his skepticism with his orthodoxy, Montaigne emphasizes that
  what he has been attacking are the pretensions of the human intellect to
  achieve truth by its own efforts. But faith is not an achievement, it is a
  free gift from God.

## Counter-Reformation philosophy

* Montaigne's exaltation of revelation to the exclusion of reason—‘fideism’
  as it came to be called—was not typical of the Counter-Reformation. In
  reaction against Luther's insistence that the human intellect and will had
  been totally corrupted by the sin of Adam, Catholic controversialists
  tended to emphasize that basic religious truths were within the scope of
  unaided human intellect, and that faith itself needed the support and
  defense of reason.
* In the forefront of this optimistic thrust of the Counter-Reformation were
  the Jesuits, the members of the new Society of Jesus. The order was
  founded by the Spanish ex-soldier Ignatius Loyola and was approved by Pope
  Paul III in 1540. In addition to the vows of poverty, chastity, and
  obedience taken by all members of religious orders, the Jesuits took a
  further vow of unquestioning loyalty to the papacy. Its members soon
  distinguished themselves in educational and missionary work in many parts
  of the world. In philosophy and theology in the universities they were
  soon able to compete with the long-established religious orders such as
  the Franciscans and Dominicans.
* Whereas medieval scholastics had based their university lectures upon
  canonical texts such as the works of Aristotle and the Sentences of Peter
  Lombard, Jesuits in universities began to replace commentaries with
  self-standing courses in philosophy and theology. By the early seventeenth
  century this pattern was adopted by Dominicans and Franciscans, and this
  led to a sharper distinction between philosophy and theology than had been
  common earlier.
* Of the philosophical issues dividing the Catholic and Protestant camps in
  the sixteenth century none was more thorny than human free will, which had
  been proclaimed at the Council of Trent in opposition no Lutheran
  determinism and Calvinist predestination. The Jesuits made themselves
  champions of the libertarian account of human freedom. Francisco Suarez
  and his Jesuit colleague Luis de Molina offered a definition of free
  agency in terms of the availability of alternative courses of
  action—‘liberty of indifference’ as it came to be known. ‘That agent is
  called free which in the presence of all necessary conditions for action
  can act and refrain from action or can do one thing while being able to do
  its opposite.’
* Such a definition did ample justice to humans' consciousness of their own
  choices and their attribution of responsibility to others. But by
  comparison with more restrictive accounts of freedom, at made it very
  difficult to account for God's foreknowledge of free human actions, to
  which both Catholics and Protestants were committed. Molina, in his famous
  *Concordia* (1589), presented an elaborate solution to the problem, in
  terms of God's comprehensive knowledge of the actions of every possible
  human being in every possible world. Ingenious though it was, Molina's
  solution was unpopular not only among Protestians but also among his
  Catholic co-religionists.

## Giordano Bruno

* Two features of Bruno's system have caught the attention of historians and
  scientists: his adoption of the Copernican hypothesis, and his postulation
  of multiple universes. Bruno accepted that it was the earth that went
  round the sun, and not the sun that went round the earth. He went on to
  develop Copernicus' ideas in a bold and dramatic manner. The earth was not
  the center of the universe: but neither was the sun. Our sun is just one
  star among others, and in boundless space there are many solar systems. No
  sun or star can be called the center of the universe, because all
  positions are relative.

## Galileo

* Already as a young man Galileo had begun to criticize the still dominant
  physics of Aristotle, not, like Bruno, on the basis of Neoplatonic
  metaphysics, but as a result of observation and experiment.
* On its own, Galileo's work in mechanics would entitle him to a place among
  the great scientists, and he also made important discoveries in
  hydrostatics. But it was his research into astronomy that brought him fame
  and tribulation. Using the newly invented telescope, which he himself
  substantially improved, he was able to observe four moons of Jupiter. He
  discovered the mountains of the moon and the variable spots on the sun;
  discoveries which showed that the heavenly bodies were not, as Aristotle
  thought, made out of a uniform crystalline quintessence, but consisted of
  the same sort of material as our own earth.
* Shortly afterwards, Galileo observed that the planet Venus wen through
  phases similar to the phases of the moon. This could only be explained, he
  concluded, if Venus was orbiting the sun and not the earth: it provided a
  powerful argument in favor of the Copernican hypothesis. The discovery of
  the moons that revolved around Jupiter in its planetary orbit had already
  disposed of one the strongest arguments urged against heliocentrism,
  namely that the moon would only be able to orbit the earth if the earth
  itself was stationary.
* Galileo was advised by the Church not to hold heretical opinions. While
  Galileo's writings were not condemned, he was silenced for several years.
* In 1632 Galileo published, with the approval of the papal censor,
  *Dialogue on the two chief world systems*. In the book one character,
  Salviati, presents the Copernican system, and another, Simplicius, defends
  the traditional one. ‘Simplicius’ was an appropriate name for the defender
  of Aristatelianism, since it had been borne by the greatest of Aristotle's
  Greek commentators. However, it could also be interpreted as meaning
  ‘simpleton’ and the pope was furious when he found some of his own words
  placed in the month of Simplicius. He concluded that Galileo had presented
  the Copernican system in a more favorable light than its opponent, and had
  therefore deviated from the terms of his license to publish. In 1633
  Galileo was summoned to Rome, tried by the Inquisition, and under the
  threat of torture forced to abjure heliocentrism. He was condemned to life
  imprisonment, a sentence that he served out until dis death in 1642, in
  confinement in the houses of distinguished friends and eventually in his
  own home at Bellosguardo outside Florence.
* Galileo was treated more humanely than Bruno and many another prisoner of
  the Inquisition, but the evil effects of his condemnation were felt
  throughout Europe. Scientific investigation in Italy went into decline.
  When in 1992 Pope John Paul II publicly acknowledged the injustice the
  Church had done to Galileo, the apology came 350 years too late.

## Bacon

* An English contemporary of Galileo, Francis Bacon, shared his antipathy to
  Aristotle, but was more interested in the theory than in the practice of
  scientific method. Born in London in 1561, Bacon was educated at Trinity
  College, Cambridge, and studied law at Gray's Inn. He entered Parliament
  in 1584 and later became a client of Queen Elizabeth's favorite, the Earl
  of Essex. When, in 1598, Essex plotted an insurrection, Bacon took a
  leading part in his prosecution for treason. On the accession of James I
  he became solicitor-general and was knighted. In 1606 he published the
  first of major philosophical writing, *The Advancement of Learning*, a
  systematic classification of scientific disciplines.
* The climax of Bacon's career was his appointment in 1618 as Lord
  Chancellor with the title Lord Verulam. He planned a massive work, the
  *Instauratio Magna (The Great Instauration)*, which was to take all
  knowledge for its province. Only two parts of this were completed: the
  first was a revision of *The Advancement of Learning*, and the second was
  the *Novum Organum* which was his principal work on scientific method. In
  1621, in the course of a parliamentary inquiry, he pleaded guilty to
  changes of accepting bribes, and was disgraced and briefly imprisoned. He
  wrote other scientific and historical works and also the essays for which
  he is nowadays best remembered. He died at Highgate in 1626.

## Descartes

* Born in 1596 in a village in Touraine.
* In the wars of religion that divided Europe, he enlisted in both camps.
  First, he was an unpaid volunteer in the army of the Protestant Prince of
  Orange; later he served in the army of the Catholic Duke Maximilian of
  Bavaria, who was then at war with the Palatine Elector Frederick,
  son-in-law of King James I of Britain. After he left the army he did not
  adopt a profession. Unlike the great philosophers of the Middle Ages he
  was a layman in both ecclesiastical and the academic sense. He never
  lectured in a university, and he lived a private life as a gentleman of
  means. He wrote his most famous work not in the Latin of the learned
  world, but in good plain French, so that it could be understood, as he put
  it, ‘even by women’.
* There are two key ideas that are presented in the *Discourse* and
  elaborated in later works. First: human beings are thinking substances.
  Second: matter is extension in motion. Everything in his system is to be
  explained in terms of this dualism of mind and matter. If we nowadays tend
  naturally to think of mind and matter as the two great mutually exclusive
  and mutually exhaustive divisions of the universe we inhabit, that is
  because of Descartes.
* Descartes reaches these conclusions by the application of a method of
  systematic doubt. To prevent being ensnared in falsehood, the philosopher
  must begin by doubting whatever can be doubted. The senses sometimes
  deceive us; mathematicians sometimes make mistakes; we can never be
  certain whether we are awake or asleep. Accordingly:
  > I decided to feign that everything that had entered my mind hitherto was
  > no more true than the illusions of dreams. But immediately upon this I
  > noticed that while I was trying to think everything false, it must needs
  > be that I, who was thinking this, was something. And observing that this
  > truth ‘I am thinking, therefore I exist’ was so solid and secure that
  > the most extravagant suppositions of skeptics could not overthrow it, I
  > judged that I need not scruple to accept it as the first principle of
  > philosophy that I was seeking.
* This is the famous *Cognito, ergo sum*, which archives the second task of
  the philosopher (MK: what is the first?), that of preventing the
  systematic doubt from leading to skepticism. But from it Descartes goes on
  to derive the principles of his system. If I were not thinking, I would
  have no reason to believe that I existed (MK: could something incapable of
  thinking believe?); hence I am a substance whose whole essence is to
  think; being a body is no part of my essence. The same goes for every
  other human being. So Descartes' first main thesis is established.
* What assures me that the *Cognito* is correct? Only that I see clearly
  that it is true. Whenever I conceive something clearly and distinctly, I
  am assured of its truth (MK: so much for systematic doubt!). But when we
  turn to material objects, we find that of all their properties the only
  ones we clearly and distinctly perceive are shape, size, and movement. So
  Descartes gains his second main thesis, that matter is extension in motion.
* What guarantees the principle that whatever I see clearly and distinctly
  is true? Only the truthful nature of the God to whom I owe my existence as
  a thinking thing (MK: good God is no deceiver!). So establishing the
  existence of God is a necessary part of Descartes' system. He offers two
  proofs that there is a God. First, I have in myself the idea of a perfect
  being, and this idea cannot be caused in me by anything less than a being
  that is itself perfect. Second, to be perfect a being must include in
  itself all perfections; but existence is a perfection, and therefore a
  perfect being must exist. MK: this is so wrong I won't spend time
  attacking it here.
* Descartes initiated a new, individualistic, style of philosophizing.
  Medieval philosophers had seen themselves as principally engaged in
  transmitting a corpus of knowledge; in the course of transmission they
  might offer improvements, but these must remain within the bounds set by
  tradition. Renaissance philosophers had seen themselves as rediscovering
  and republicizing the lost wisdom of ancient times. It was Descartes who
  was the first philosopher since Antiquity to offer himself as a total
  innovator; as the person who had the privilege of setting out the truth
  about man and his universe for the very first time. Where Descartes trod,
  others followed: Locke, Hume, and Kant each offered their philosophies as
  new creations, constructed for the first time on sound scientific
  principles. ‘Read my work, and discard my predecessors’ is a constant
  theme of 17th and 18th-century thinkers and writers.
* With medieval philosophers like Aquinas, Scotus, and Ockham, a student has
  to read the texts closely to realize the great degree of innovation that
  is going on: the new wine is always decanted so carefully into the old
  bottles. With Descartes and his successors, the difficulty is the
  opposite: one has to look outside the text to realize that much that is
  presented as original insight is in fact to be found stated in earlier
  authors. There is no need to doubt the sincerity of Descartes' repeated
  statements that he owed nothing to his scholastic predecessors. He was not
  a plagiarist, but he had no appreciation of how much he had imbibed from
  the intellectual atmosphere in which he grew up.
* When Descartes tried to doubt everything, the one thing he did not call
  into question was the meaning of the words he was using in his solitary
  meditation. Had he done so, he would have had to realize that even the
  words we use in soliloquy derive their meaning from the social community
  which is the home of our language, and therefore it was not, in fact,
  possible to build up his philosophy from solitary private ideas. Again,
  Descartes thought that it was not possible to call into question
  propositions that he was taught by natural light—the clear and distinct
  perceptions that form the basic building blocks of his system. But in
  fact, too often when he tells us that something is taught by the natural
  light in our solus, he produces a doctrine that he had imbibed from the
  Jesuits at La Flèche.
* There is no doubt of the enormous influence Descartes has exercised from
  his own day to ours. But his relation to modern philosophy is not that of
  father to son, nor of architect to palace, nor of planner to city. Rather,
  in the history of philosophy his position is like that of the waist of an
  hourglass. As the sand in the upper chamber of such a glass reaches its
  lower chamber only through the slender passage between the two, so too
  ideas that had their origin in the Middle Ages have reached the modern
  world through a narrow filter: the compressing genius of Descartes.

## Hobbes

* Descartes and Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) had much in common. They shared a
  contempt for Aristotle and the Aristotelian establishment in the
  universities. Both were solitary thinkers who spent significant parts of
  their lives in exile—each, for a time, beholden to banished Stuart courts.
  Both of them had very modest libraries, and were contemptuous of
  book-learning. Hobbes, like Descartes, was a master of vernacular prose,
  and wrote for popular reading as well as for the learned world.
* The most significant philosophical agreement between the two men was that
  each of them was convinced that the material world was to be explained
  solely in terms of motion. ‘The causes of universal things (of those, at
  least, that have any cause) are manifest of themselves, or (as they say
  commonly) known to nature; so that they need no method at all; for hey
  have all but one universal cause, which is motion,’ wrote Hobbes. Like
  Descartes, Hobbes denied the objective reality of secondary properties
  such as color, sound, and heat, and indeed of all real accidents.
* However, while Hobbes was close to one half of Descartes' philosophy, his
  philosophy of matter, he was strongly opposed to the other half, his
  philosophy of mind. Indeed he denied the existence of mind in the sense in
  which Descartes understood it.There was, for Hobbes, no such thing as a
  non-bodily substance, unextended and unmoving. There were no incorporeal
  spirits, human, angelic, or divine. The very expression ‘incorporeal
  substance’, he said, was as absurd as ‘round quadrangle’. Historians
  disagree whether Hobbes' materialism involved a denial of the existence of
  God, or implied that God was a body of some infinite and invisible kind.
  It is unlikely that he was an atheist; but he certainly denied the dualism
  of mind and matter in human beings.
* In *Leviathan, or the Matter, Form and Power of a Commonwealth
  Ecclesiastical and Civil* Hobbes argues that principles of rational
  self-interest would urge men to give up some of their unfettered liberty
  in return for equal concessions by others. Such principles would lead them
  to transfer their rights, save that of self-defense, to a central power
  able to enforce laws by punishment. A covenant of every man with every man
  sets up a supreme sovereign, himself not a party to the covenant and
  therefore incapable of breaching it. Such a sovereign is the source of law
  and property rights, and it is his function to enforce, not just the
  original covenant that constitutes the state, but individual covenants
  that his subjects make with each other.
* Hobbes' fame in the history of philosophy rests above all on his
  contribution to political philosophy. He himself, however, attached great
  importance to his philosophy of language. The invention of printing, he
  observes, was no great matter compared with the invention of writing, and
  that in its turn is insignificant compared to the invention of speech,
  which is what marks us off from beasts and makes us capable of pursuing
  science. Without words ‘there had been amongst men, neither commonwealth,
  nor society, nor contract, nor peace, no more than amongst lions, bears,
  and wolves.’
* Hobbes is a thoroughgoing nominalist: all words are names, and names refer
  only to individuals. Names may be proper, such as ‘Peter’, or common, such
  as ‘horse’; and they may also be abstract, such as ‘life’ or ‘length’.
  Universal names like ‘man’ and ‘tree’ do not name any universal thing in
  the world or any idea in the mind, but name many individuals. For Hobbes,
  names are put together to make sentences. If we say ‘Socrates is just’,
  the semantic relationship of the word ‘just’ to the man Socrates is
  exactly the same as the relationship of the word ‘Socrates’: both are
  names, and the predicate term in the sentence signifies in the same way as
  the subject term does. Sentences are true when the two names they contain
  are both names of the same thing. ‘A man is a living creature’ is true
  because ‘living creature’ is a name of everything that is signified by
  ‘man’. ‘Every man is just’ is false because ‘just’ is not a name of every
  man, the greater part of mankind deserving the name ‘unjust’. The two-name
  theory is a naive piece of semantics which would not survive serious
  logical criticism such as it had received in the medieval period and as it
  was to receive in the 19th century in the work of Gottlob Frege. Hobbes'
  version of the theory is a particularly crude one by comparison with that
  of its leading medieval proponent, William Ockham. It remained
  influential, however, among the British empiricists whom many have seen as
  the heirs of the tradition of Ockham and Hobbes.

## The Cambridge Platonists

* A group of half a dozen English philosophers in the mid-17th century
  occupied a position at odds with both Hobbes and Descartes. Five of them,
  of whom the most important was Ralph Cudworth (1617-88), were graduates of
  Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and one of them, Henry More (1614-87), was a
  graduate of Christ's College, Cambridge, of which Cudworth was for thirty
  years master. All of them shared an admiration for Plato, Plotinus, and
  their followers among the early Church Fathers. Hence the group is
  commonly called the ‘Cambridge Platonists’.
* Despite their Cambridge affiliation, the members of the group were hostile
  to the Puritanism that prevailed in that town and university during the
  Civil War. They rejected Calvinist doctrines of predestination, affirmed
  human freedom, and preached the merits of religious toleration. Their
  toleration, however, did not extend to atheists, and the focus of their
  hostility was Hobbes, whose materialism they regarded as tantamount to
  atheism. During the reign of Charles I Puritan hostility to the Anglican
  hierarchy had been followed by the deposition and execution of the king.
  For the Cambridge Platonists the political slogan ‘No bishop, no king’ had
  a philosophical counterpart: ‘No spirit, no God’. One could not be
  materialist and a theist at the same time.
* Cambridge Platonists sided with Descartes against Hobbes in emphasizing
  the distinction of mind from matter. They devoted themselves to proving
  the immortality of the human soul and the existence of a spiritual God.
  For More, a human being is ‘a created spirit endowed with sense and
  reason, and a power of organizing terrestrial matter into human shape.’
  Like Descartes, Cudworth argues that God's existence can be proved by the
  presence is us of the idea of God: ‘Were there no God the idea of an
  absolutely or infinitely perfect Being could never have been made or
  feigned, neither by politicians, nor by poets, nor philosophers, nor any
  other.’ MK: why not? Clearly we can conceive of various things that do not
  exist if they are buildable from notions that we possess.
* The Cambridge Platonists parted company with Descartes when they came to
  explain the basis of fundamental ethical principles. It was quite wrong,
  Cudworth complained, to say that moral and other eternal truths depended
  on the omnipotent will of God and were therefore in principle variable.
  ‘Virtue and holiness in creatures’, he told the House of Commons in a 1647
  sermon, ‘are not therefore Good because God loves them, and will have them
  be accounted such; but rather, God therefore love them because they are in
  themselves simply good.’
* The Platonists' disagreement with Descartes was much sharper when they
  came to consider his account of the material world. They were not opposed
  to new developments in science—both Cudworth and More were members of the
  Royal Society—but they denied that the phenomena could be accounted for
  mechanistically in terms of matter and motion. Unlike Descartes, they
  believed that animals had consciousness and sensitive souls; and even the
  fall of a heavy body, they believed, needed to be explained by the action
  an immaterial principle. This did not mean that God did everything
  directly, as it were with his own hands, but rather that he had entrusted
  the physical world to an intermediary, ‘a plastic nature’ akin to a
  world-soul, that acted regularly and teleologically. Those like Descartes
  who rejected teleology were mere ‘mechanic theists’ and were little better
  than the materialist Hobbes.

## John Locke (1632-1704)

* Locke's greatest philosophical work is the *Essay concerning human
  understanding*. The *Essay* consists of four books. The first and
  shortest, entitled ‘Of innate notions’, argues that there are no innate
  principle in our minds, whether speculative or practical. All our ideas
  are derived, either directly or by combination or reflection, from
  experience. Even in the case of *a priori* disciplines such as geometry,
  the ideas that we employ are not innate. ‘Idea’ is the catch-all term that
  Locke employs to characterize our mental skills and the concepts of our
  minds. Locke classified ideas in various ways: there are simple ideas and
  complex ideas; there are clear and distinct and obscure and confused
  ideas; there are ideas of sensations and idea of reflection. In dealing
  with simple ideas, Locke divides the qualities to be found in bodies into
  two categories, primary qualities such as solidity, motion, and figure,
  which are in bodies ‘whether we perceive them or no’, and secondary
  qualities such as colors, which ‘are nothing in the objects themselves,
  but powers to produce various sensations in us by their primary
  qualities’. Among the ideas of reflection the first and most important is
  the idea of perception, for this is the first exercise of the mind upon
  ideas. Perception is a purely passive experience, and everyone knows what
  it is by looking within himself. The passive experiences of perception are
  the bedrock on which Locke builds his philosophy.
* The second book of the *Essay* present an empiricist philosophy of mind
  and will, but it contains much else: reflections on time, space, and
  number, for instance, and a catalogue of human passions. It deals with
  casual and other relations, and it contains an elaborate and highly
  influential discussion of the nature of personal identity.
* Although Locke believes that we can recognize simple ideas within
  ourselves unaided, and that if we cannot recognize them no words will help
  us to do so, he does in practice identify the ideas that he is talking
  about by means of the words that express them. He admits that ‘our
  abstract ideas, and general words, have so constant a relation one to
  another, that it is impossible to speak clearly and distinctly of our
  Knowledge, which all consists in propositions, without considering, first,
  the nature, use and signification of language.’
* To that topic, then, he devotes his third book. The most famous sections
  of this book are the discussions of abstract ideas and the theory of
  substance. The mind, Locke says, observing likeness among natural objects,
  sorts them under abstract general ideas, to which it attaches general
  names. These general ideas have, he tells us, remarkable properties: the
  general idea of a triangle, for instance ‘must be neither oblique nor
  rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural nor scalenon, but all and none
  of these at once’. (MK: not sure I understand this.) Substances in the
  world possess various qualities and powers which we make use of when we
  define things of different kinds; but the definitions we give them do not
  reveal their real essences, but only a ‘nominal essence’. Of substance in
  general the only idea we have is of ‘something we know not what’ is which
  properties inhere.
* Epistemological considerations are ubiquitous throughout the *Essay*, but
  it is the fourth book that is officially devoted to the topic of
  knowledge. Because the real essences of things are unknown to us, we
  cannot have true science about items in the natural world, but only
  probable belief. We can have genuine knowledge of our own existence and of
  the existence of God; and provided we keep within the bounds of actual
  sensation, we can have knowledge of the existence of other things. The
  love of truth should prevent us from entertaining any propositions with
  greater assurance than the evidence we have for it: ‘Whoever goes beyond
  this measure of assent, it is plain, receives not truth in the love of it,
  loves not truth for truth's sake, but for some other by end.’

## Pascal

* Born in 1632, Pascal was the son of a royal official in the Auvergne. A
  precocious child, educated at home, he was already publishing on the
  geometry of conic sections at the age of sixteen, and he invented a
  rudimentary computer to assist his father in tax assessment. He inspired a
  series of experiments which proved the empirical possibility of a vacuum,
  which had been denied *a priori* by Descartes. Later in life he took a
  significant part in the development of the mathematical study of
  probability, and he can claim to be one of the founders of game theory.
* In his own mind, his work in mathematics and physics came to seem a matter
  of secondary importance. In 1654 he had a religious experience which led
  him to make devotion and theology his main concern. He became a close
  associate of a group of ascetics which centered on the convent of Port
  Royal, which his sister Jacqueline had become a nun in 1652. Members of
  the group were called ‘Jansenists’ because they revered the memory of the
  Dutch Bishop Jansenius who had written a famous treatise on St Augustine,
  which defended a pessimistic and rigorist version of Catholicism.
  Jansenism stressed the corruption of fallen human nature, and held out
  hope of salvation only to a small minority of the human race. In our
  present state, some divine commands were impossible for human beings to
  obey, even with the best will in the world. There was little scope for
  free will: on the one hand, sin was unavoidable, and on the other hand,
  grace was irresistible.
* Such teaching was condemned by Pope Innocent X in 1653, but the Jansenists
  fought a long rearguard battle, and their influence on Pascal remained
  profound. In accord with their devaluation of the powers of fallen human
  nature, Pascal was sceptical of the power of philosophy, especially in
  relation to knowledge of God. ‘The true way to philosophize’, he once
  wrote, ‘is to have no time for philosophy’; as for Descartes, he was
  ‘useless and uncertain’.
* Pascal was a master of aphorism, and many of his sayings have become
  familiar quotations. ‘The eternal silence of the infinite spaces terrifies
  me’; ‘Had Cleopatra's nose been shorter, the whole face of the world would
  have been changed’, ‘We die alone’. One of the most striking is this:
  > Man is only a reed, the frailest thing in nature; but he is a thinking
  > reed. To crush him it does not take the whole universe in arms: a breath
  > of wind, a drop of water is enough to kill him. But were the universe to
  > crush him, mun would still be nobler than his killer. For he knows that
  > he is dying and that the universe has the better of him. But the
  > universe knows nothing of this.
* Two themes recur in the surviving materials: the misery of humanity
  without God, and the happiness promised by the religious life:
  > The wretchedness of our condition is made clear by the philosophical
  > debate between skeptics and rationalists. The skeptics are right that we
  > cannot even be certain whether we are awake or asleep; the rationalists
  > are right that there are some natural principles we cannot doubt. But
  > whether these principles are true or not, depends on whether we come
  > from a good God or from an evil demon. And we cannot know; without
  > faith, whether there is a God: nature offers no satisfactory proof that
  > he exists. The best we can do, if we do not accept revelation, is to bet
  > on his existence.
  MK: in what sense these “natural principles” can be not true? Can
  mathematics be different in some different universe that is controlled by
  an evil demon as compared to our universe that is supposedly controlled by
  a good God? And even if we suppose that the answer to that question is
  yes, then natural principles seem to be related to the universe in which
  they apply, and so they are true in that universe and cannot be false
  (there can be mistaken beliefs, which is different); it does not really
  make sense to talk about “natural principles” as being true or false in a
  scope beyond their universe if we accept that they are such principles
  that are universe-dependent.
* Human nature as we know it is a mass of contradiction. We have an ideal of
  truth, and yet we possess only untruth. We have a yearning for happiness,
  and we cannot achieve it. Humanity is something monstrous: ‘Chaotic,
  contradictory, and prodigious; judge of everything and mindless
  earth-worm, storehouse of truth and cesspool of terror; the glory and
  refuse of the universe.’
* The solution to this riddle is contained in the Christian doctrine of the
  Fall. It is clear that the human condition is twofold. If humans had never
  been corrupted they would have enjoyed in their innocent state both truth
  and happiness. If they had never been other than corrupted, they would
  never have any notion of either truth or happiness. But the Fall, which is
  the key to understanding of ourselves, is of all Christian teachings the
  one most shocking to reason:
  > What is more contrary to laws of our wretched justice than eternally to
  > damn a child with no will of its own for a sin in which the child had so
  > small a part to play that it was committed sex thousand yeas before the
  > child came into existence? Certainly, nothing shocks us more deeply than
  > this doctrine. Nevertheless without this most incomprehensible of all
  > mysteries we are incomprehensible to ourselves.
* But if reason revolts at the idea of the Fall, reason can also establish
  the idea's truth. The starting point is nothing other than human misery:
  > The greatness of man is so evident that it can be inferred even from his
  > wretchedness. For that which is nature in animals we call wretchedness
  > in man. And by this we recognize that his nature being now like that of
  > the animals, he is fallen from a better nature which formerly was his.
  > For who is unhappy at not being a king, except a deposed king?
  MK: this is a nice thought, but it is too simplistic. Surely, there can be
  a more complex type of nature that is sometimes closer to the animal one
  and at other times rises “above” that.

## Malebranche (1638–1715)

* An enthusiastic follower of Descartes.
* Malebranche accepted Cartesian dualism: minds were thinking substances and
  the essence of matter was extension. But he tried to improve upon
  Descartes' account of the relationship between mind and body, long
  recognized as the weakest point in the Cartesian system. More consistently
  than Descartes, Malebranche argued that if mind was pure thought, and
  matter was pure extension, neither could act upon the other. Mind and body
  run parallel, but do not interact. ‘It seems to me quite certain that the
  will of spiritual beings is incapable of moving the smallest body in the
  world. It is evident, for example, that there is no necessary connection
  between our will to move our arm and our arm's movement.’ Sure, my arm
  moves *when* I will, but not *because* I will. If it was really myself
  moving my arm, I would know how I do it; but I cannot even explain how I
  wiggle my finger.
* If I do not move my arm, who does? God does, answers Malebranche. God is
  the only true cause. Not only can minds not act on body; neither can
  bodies act on bodies. If bodies collide and move away from each other,
  what really happens is that God wills each of them to be in the
  appropriate places at the appropriate moments. MK: this account has no
  explanatory power.
* Can bodies act on minds? Malebranche denies that our ideas come from the
  bodies they represent, or that they are created by ourselves. They come
  directly from God, who alone is capable of acting causally on our
  intellects. If I prick my finger with a needle, the pain does not come
  from the needle: it is directly caused by God. We see all things in God:
  God is the environment in which minds live, just as space is the
  environment in which bodies are located. It was this teaching which
  particularly aroused the imagination of John Locke.
* Many Christian thinkers, from St Augustine onwards, had held that human
  beings see the eternal truths and the moral laws by contemplating, in some
  manner, ideas in the mind of God. In making this claim Malebranche could
  claim august authority. But it was a novelty to say that our knowledge of
  changeable material objects depends on immediate divine illumination. God,
  after all, is not himself material or changeable: all there is to be seen
  in God is the pure idea of intelligible extension. How does contemplation
  of the eternal divine archetype of extension convey to us any knowledge of
  the contingent history of bodies moving and changing in the world about
  us?
* The answer that Malebranche gives us is that in seeing the archetype of
  extension we are also made aware of all the laws of Cartesian physics that
  govern the behavior of the material world. If this is to be sufficient to
  predict the actual course of the universe the laws must fulfill two
  conditions: they must be simple laws and they must be general laws. MK:
  the universe is a fully deterministic system with sensitive dependence on
  initial conditions, so that the whole setup is immutable and so any
  contingent detail can be equally seen in one immutable source, God? Still
  don't see why the laws should necessarily be “simple”.
* Malebranche's belief in the simplicity and generality of fundamental laws
  not only solves the epistemological problems about our knowledge of the
  external world, but also the moral problem of the presence of evil among
  the creatures of a good God. God could have made a world more perfect than
  ours, but to do that he would have had to alter the simplicity of the
  laws. Moreover, once God has established laws it is beneath his dignity
  (MK: love this formulation) to tinker with them; laws must be general not
  only for all places but for all times.

## Spinoza (1632–1677)

* In 1665 Spinoza decided to write an apologia justifying his departure from
  Judaism: this grew into a much more general work of biblical criticism and
  political theory, the *Tractatus Theologico-Politicus*, which was
  published anonymously in 1670.
* It is clear that sacred writers were ignorant human beings, children of
  their time and place, and full of prejudices of various sorts. If a
  prophet was a peasant he was visions of oxen; if a courtier, he saw a
  throne. ‘God has no particular style in speaking, but according to the
  learning and capacity of the prophet he is cultivated, compressed, severe,
  untutored, prolix, or obscure.’
* The defects of the prophets did not hinder them from carrying out their
  task, which was not to teach us truth but to encourage us to obedience. It
  is absurd to look to the Bible for scientific information; anyone who does
  so will believe that the sun revolves round the earth, and that the value
  of π is 3. Science and Scripture have different functions, and neither is
  superior to the other; theology is not bound to serve reason, nor reason
  theology.
* The *Tractatus* is carefully argued and courteously expressed, and in
  drawing critical attention to the literary genres of Scripture, Spinoza
  was merely anticipating what devout Protestants were to say in the 19th
  century (‘the Bible must be read like any other book’) and what devout
  Catholics were to say in the 20th century (the interpreter of the Bible
  must ‘go back in spirit to those remote centuries of the East’).
  Nonetheless, the book's liberal interpretation of the Old Testament drew a
  storm of protest not only from Jews but from the Dutch Calvinists, who
  condemned the book in several synods. Other contemporaries, however,
  admired the book and when its authorship became generally known it gave
  Spinoza an international reputation.
* *Ethics demonstrated according to the geometrical order* sets out
  Spinoza's own systems in the way he had earlier set out Descartes, on the
  model of Euclid's geometry. It is in five parts: ‘Of God’, ‘Of the nature
  and origin of the mind’, ‘Of the origin and nature of the passions’, ‘Of
  human bondage’, and ‘Of Human freedom’. Each part begins with a set of
  definitions and axioms and proceeds to offer formal proofs of numbered
  propositions, each containing, we are to believe, nothing that does not
  follow from the axioms and definitions, and concluding with QED. The
  geometrical method cannot be regarded as a successful method of
  presentation. The poofs often offer little understanding of the
  conclusions, and provide at best a set of hypertext links to other
  passages of the *Ethics*. The philosophical meat is often packed into
  scholia, corollaries, and appendices.
* Whereas for Descartes there were two fundamental kind of substance, mental
  and material, for Spinoza there is only a single substance (which may be
  called either ‘God’ or ‘Nature’) which possesses both the attribute of
  thought and the attribute of extension. The human mind the human body,
  therefore, do not belong in two different worlds: the mind, as is
  explained in the second book, is man considered as a mode of the attribute
  of thought, and the body is man considered as a mode of the attribute of
  extension. Mind and body are inseparable: the human mind is in fact simply
  the idea of the human body (MK: this is not quite clear to me). On this
  foundation, Spinoza builds up an epistemological theory of three levels of
  knowledge: imagination, reason, and intuition.
* Passive emotions, like fear and anger, are generated by external forces;
  active emotions arise from the mind's own understanding of the human
  condition. Once we have a clear and distinct idea of a passive emotion it
  becomes an active emotion; and the replacement of passive emotions by
  active ones is the path of liberation. In particular we must give up the
  passion of fear, and especially the fear of death.
* Moral liberation depends, paradoxically, on the appreciation of the
  necessity of all things. We will cease to feel hatred for others when we
  realize that their acts are determined by nature. Returning hatred only
  increases it; but reciprocating it with love vanquishes it. What we must
  do is to take a God's eye view of the whole necessary natural scheme of
  things, seeing it ‘in the light of eternity’.
* Spinoza's unique system can be looked at historically in several different
  ways. We can, if we wish, situate his theory of substance in relation to
  Locke's. Both Locke and Spinoza eliminate the Aristotelian notion of
  substance: for Locke, individual substances vanish to a virtual zero, for
  Spinoza substance expands so far that a single substance encompasses the
  universe. But if we take Descartes as our point of comparison, we can say
  that in drawing out the implications of Cartesian assumptions (MK: not
  sure if this can be said, Spinoza does not seem to share Descartes' main
  assumption about the dichotomy of mental vs material substances) Spinoza
  overtook Malebranche. Malebranche drew the conclusion that God was the
  only agent in the universe; Spinoza went further and claimed that he was
  the only substance. But when Spinoza says that this single substance is
  ‘God or Nature’, does this mean that he is a pantheist or an atheist? He
  has been taken with equal justification to be alleging that ‘God’ is just
  a code word for the order of the natural universe, and to be claiming that
  when scientists speak of ‘Nature’ they are all the time talking of ‘God’.

## Leibniz (1646–1716)

* In winter of 1685 Leibniz wrote the first of his works which became
  lastingly popular, *The discourse on metaphysics*. Brief and lucid, it
  serves to this day as the best introduction to his philosophical system,
  and contains many of his characteristic doctrines.
* The first of these is that we live in the best of all possible worlds, a
  world freely chosen by God who always acts in an orderly manner according
  to reason. God is not, as Spinoza thought, the only substance: there are
  also created individuals. Each individual through its history has many
  predicates true of it, predicates whose totality defines it as the
  substance it is. Each such substance expresses the universe after its own
  manner, encapsulating the world from a particular viewpoint. Human beings
  are substances of this kind: their actions are contingent, not necessary,
  and depending on free will. Our choices have reasons, but not
  necessitating causes. Created substances do not directly act upon each
  other, but God has so arranged matters that what happens to one substance
  corresponds to what happens to all the others. Consequently, each
  substance is like a world apart, independent of any other thing save God.
* The human mind contains, from its origin, the ideas of all things; no
  external object, other than God, can act upon our souls. Our ideas,
  however, are our own ideas and not God's. So too are the acts of our will,
  which God inclines without necessitating. God conserves us continually in
  being, but our thoughts occur spontaneously and freely. Soul and body do
  not interact, but thoughts and bodily events occur in correspondence
  because they are placed in liaison by the loving providence of God. God
  has so ordered things that spirits, the most precious items in the
  universe, live forever in full self-consciousness; and for those that love
  him he has prepared unimaginable felicity.
* In 1714 two of Leibniz's most important short treatises appeared: the
  *Monadology* and *The principle of nature and of grace*. The *Monadology*
  contains a developed and polished form of the system adumbrated in the
  *Discourse*. Whatever is complex is made up of what is simple, and
  whatever is simple is unextended, for if it were extended it could be
  further divided. But whatever is material is extended, hence there must be
  simple immaterial elements. These soul-like entities Leibniz called
  monads—these are the ‘worlds apart’ of the *Discourse*. Whereas for
  Spinoza there was only one substance, with the attributes of both mind and
  extension, for Leibniz there are infinitely many substances, which the
  properties only of souls.
* Like Malebranche, Leibniz denied that creatures could be causally affected
  by other creatures. ‘Monads have no windows, by which anything could come
  in or go out.’ Their life is a succession of mental states or perceptions,
  bet these are not caused by the external world. A monad mirrors the world,
  not because the world shines into it, but because God has programmed it to
  change in synchrony with the world.

# Historical overview

## Humanism and reform

* Erasmus, More, and their friends propounded in Northern Europe the
  humanist ideas that had taken root in Italy in the previous century.
  ‘Humanism’ at that time did not mean a desire to replace religious values
  with secular human ones: Erasmus was a priest who wrote best-selling works
  of piety, and More was later martyred for his religious beliefs.
  Humanists, rather, were people who believed in the educational value of
  the ‘humane letters’ (*literae humaniores*) of the Greek and Latin
  classics.
* Humanists valued grammar, philology, and rhetoric more highly than the
  technical philosophical studies that had preoccupied scholars during the
  Middle Ages. They despised the Latin that had been the lingua franca of
  medieval universities.
* Erasmus was more interested in divinity than in philosophy, and he cared
  more for biblical studies than for speculative theology. Scholastics like
  Scotus and Ockham, he complained, merely choked with brambles paths that
  had been made plain by earlier thinkers.
* Luther was an Augustinian monk, as Erasmus had been until released by
  papal dispensation from his monastic commitments. Like Erasmus, Luther had
  made a close study of St Paul's Epistle to the Romans. This had made him
  question fundamentally the ethos of Renaissance Catholicism. The year
  after the publication of Erasmus' New Testament Luther issued, in the
  University of Wittenberg, a public denunciation of abuses of papal
  authority, in particular of a scandalously promoted offer of an indulgence
  in return for contributions to the building of the great new church of St
  Peters' in Rome.
* In 1520 Pope Leo X condemned forty-one articles taken from Luther's
  teaching, and followed this up with an excommunication after Luther had
  burnt the Bull of Condemnation.

## Sin, grace, and freedom

* Adrian VI urged Erasmus to take up his pen against the reformers. The
  ground Erasmus chose for battle was Luther's position on the freedom of
  the will. Philosophically, Erasmus is unsubtle. He refers to, but does not
  improve upon, Valla's dialogue on free will. He repeats commonplaces of
  centuries of scholastic debate which are inadequate responses to the
  problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge with human freedom—he insists,
  for instance, that even humans know many things that will happen in the
  future, such as eclipses of the sun. A theory of free will that leaves us
  no freer than the starts in their courses is not a very robust answer to
  Luther.
* Luther the opinion that the Council of Constance ascribed to Wyclif: that
  everything happens of ‘necessity’. He distinguishes, however, between two
  senses of ‘necessity’. The human will is subject to ‘necessity of
  immutability’: it has no power to change itself from its innate desire for
  evil. But it is not subject to another form of necessity, namely
  compulsion: a human being lacking grace does evil spontaneously and
  willingly. The human will is like a beast of burden: if God rides it, it
  wills and goes where God wills; if Satan rides it, it goes where Satan
  wills. It has no freedom to choose its rider.
* Luther prefers to abandon altogether the term ‘free will’; other writers,
  before and after, have regarded the spontaneity that he accepts as being
  the only thing that can genuinely be meant by the term. Luther's principal
  concern was to deny free will in matters that make the difference between
  salvation and damnation. In other cases he seems to allow the possibility
  of genuine choice between alternative courses of action. Humans have free
  will in respect not of what is above them, but in respect of what is below
  them. The sinner, for instance, can make his choice between a variety of
  sins.
* From a philosophical point of view these early Reformation debates on
  freedom and determinism do no more than rehearse arguments which were
  commonplaces of ancient and medieval philosophy. They illustrate, however,
  the negative side of humanist education. Scholastic debates, if sometimes
  arid, had commonly been sober and courteous. Thomas Aquinas', for
  instance, was always anxious to put the best possible interpretation on
  the theses of those he disagreed with. Erasmus shared something of
  Aquinas' eirenic spirit; but More and Luther attack each other with bitter
  vituperation made only the more vulgar by the elegant Latin in which it is
  phrased. The pugnacious conventions of humanist debate were a factor which
  led to the hardening of positions on either side of the Reformation
  divide.

## Humanism and reform

* Erasmus, More, and their friends propounded in Northern Europe the
  humanist ideas that had taken root in Italy in the previous century.
  ‘Humanism’ at that time did not mean a desire to replace religious values
  with secular human ones: Erasmus was a priest who wrote best-selling works
  of piety, and More was later martyred for his religious beliefs.
  Humanists, rather, were people who believed in the educational value of
  the ‘humane letters’ (*literae humaniores*) of the Greek and Latin
  classics.
* Humanists valued grammar, philology, and rhetoric more highly than the
  technical philosophical studies that had preoccupied scholars during the
  Middle Ages. They despised the Latin that had been the lingua franca of
  medieval universities.
* Erasmus was more interested in divinity than in philosophy, and he cared
  more for biblical studies than for speculative theology. Scholastics like
  Scotus and Ockham, he complained, merely choked with brambles paths that
  had been made plain by earlier thinkers.
* Luther was an Augustinian monk, as Erasmus had been until released by
  papal dispensation from his monastic commitments. Like Erasmus, Luther had
  made a close study of St Paul's Epistle to the Romans. This had made him
  question fundamentally the ethos of Renaissance Catholicism. The year
  after the publication of Erasmus' New Testament Luther issued, in the
  University of Wittenberg, a public denunciation of abuses of papal
  authority, in particular of a scandalously promoted offer of an indulgence
  in return for contributions to the building of the great new church of St
  Peters' in Rome.
* In 1520 Pope Leo X condemned forty-one articles taken from Luther's
  teaching, and followed this up with an excommunication after Luther had
  burnt the Bull of Condemnation.

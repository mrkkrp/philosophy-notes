# Historical overview

## Humanism and reform

* Erasmus, More, and their friends propounded in Northern Europe the
  humanist ideas that had taken root in Italy in the previous century.
  ‘Humanism’ at that time did not mean a desire to replace religious values
  with secular human ones: Erasmus was a priest who wrote best-selling works
  of piety, and More was later martyred for his religious beliefs.
  Humanists, rather, were people who believed in the educational value of
  the ‘humane letters’ (*literae humaniores*) of the Greek and Latin
  classics.
* Humanists valued grammar, philology, and rhetoric more highly than the
  technical philosophical studies that had preoccupied scholars during the
  Middle Ages. They despised the Latin that had been the lingua franca of
  medieval universities.
* Erasmus was more interested in divinity than in philosophy, and he cared
  more for biblical studies than for speculative theology. Scholastics like
  Scotus and Ockham, he complained, merely choked with brambles paths that
  had been made plain by earlier thinkers.
* Luther was an Augustinian monk, as Erasmus had been until released by
  papal dispensation from his monastic commitments. Like Erasmus, Luther had
  made a close study of St Paul's Epistle to the Romans. This had made him
  question fundamentally the ethos of Renaissance Catholicism. The year
  after the publication of Erasmus' New Testament Luther issued, in the
  University of Wittenberg, a public denunciation of abuses of papal
  authority, in particular of a scandalously promoted offer of an indulgence
  in return for contributions to the building of the great new church of St
  Peters' in Rome.
* In 1520 Pope Leo X condemned forty-one articles taken from Luther's
  teaching, and followed this up with an excommunication after Luther had
  burnt the Bull of Condemnation.

## Sin, grace, and freedom

* Adrian VI urged Erasmus to take up his pen against the reformers. The
  ground Erasmus chose for battle was Luther's position on the freedom of
  the will. Philosophically, Erasmus is unsubtle. He refers to, but does not
  improve upon, Valla's dialogue on free will. He repeats commonplaces of
  centuries of scholastic debate which are inadequate responses to the
  problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge with human freedom—he insists,
  for instance, that even humans know many things that will happen in the
  future, such as eclipses of the sun. A theory of free will that leaves us
  no freer than the starts in their courses is not a very robust answer to
  Luther.
* Luther the opinion that the Council of Constance ascribed to Wyclif: that
  everything happens of ‘necessity’. He distinguishes, however, between two
  senses of ‘necessity’. The human will is subject to ‘necessity of
  immutability’: it has no power to change itself from its innate desire for
  evil. But it is not subject to another form of necessity, namely
  compulsion: a human being lacking grace does evil spontaneously and
  willingly. The human will is like a beast of burden: if God rides it, it
  wills and goes where God wills; if Satan rides it, it goes where Satan
  wills. It has no freedom to choose its rider.
* Luther prefers to abandon altogether the term ‘free will’; other writers,
  before and after, have regarded the spontaneity that he accepts as being
  the only thing that can genuinely be meant by the term. Luther's principal
  concern was to deny free will in matters that make the difference between
  salvation and damnation. In other cases he seems to allow the possibility
  of genuine choice between alternative courses of action. Humans have free
  will in respect not of what is above them, but in respect of what is below
  them. The sinner, for instance, can make his choice between a variety of
  sins.
* From a philosophical point of view these early Reformation debates on
  freedom and determinism do no more than rehearse arguments which were
  commonplaces of ancient and medieval philosophy. They illustrate, however,
  the negative side of humanist education. Scholastic debates, if sometimes
  arid, had commonly been sober and courteous. Thomas Aquinas', for
  instance, was always anxious to put the best possible interpretation on
  the theses of those he disagreed with. Erasmus shared something of
  Aquinas' eirenic spirit; but More and Luther attack each other with bitter
  vituperation made only the more vulgar by the elegant Latin in which it is
  phrased. The pugnacious conventions of humanist debate were a factor which
  led to the hardening of positions on either side of the Reformation
  divide.

## Authority and conscience

* Luther introduced a general hostility not just to scholasticism but to
  philosophy itself. He denounced Aristotle, and in particular his *Ethics*,
  as ‘the vilest enemy of grace’. His contempt for the powers of unaided
  reason was the outcome of his belief that in Adam's fall human nature had
  become totally corrupt and impotent.
* Pessimism about the moral capacity of the trained intellect unaided by
  grace went hand in hand with optimism about the intellectual ability of
  the untrained mind illumined by faith. Squeezed between the two,
  philosophy found its role greatly diminished among devout Protestants.
* In Rome Pope Paul III (1534-9) promoted a Counter-Reformation, instituting
  a new religious order of Jesuits, and convening a Council at Tent to
  reform Church discipline. The council condemned the Lutheran doctrine of
  justification by faith alone, and the Calvinist doctrine that God
  predestined the wicked to hell prior to any sin. Free will, it insisted,
  had not been extinguished by Adam's fall. It reaffirmed the doctrine of
  transubstantiation and the traditional seven sacraments. By the time the
  council had finished its work, in 1563, Luther was dead and Calvin was
  dying.

## The decline of logic

* The combined effects of the Renaissance and the Reformation made the
  sixteenth century a barren one in most areas of philosophy. Logic was
  perhaps the branch of philosophy that suffered most severely. Logic did
  continue to be taught in the universities, but humanist scholars were
  impatient of it, regarding its terminology as barbarous and its
  complexities as pettifogging.

## Skepticism, sacred and profane

* Sebastian Castellio wrote *Whether Heretics are to be persecuted* (1554)
  in which he pleaded in favor of toleration. His arguments are mainly
  quotations of authoritative texts or appeals to the example of Christ. In
  a later work, *The art of doubting*, Castellio developed more
  epistemological arguments. The difficulty of interpreting Scripture, and
  the variety of opinions among Christian sects, should make us very
  cautious in laying down the law on religious matters. To be sure, there
  are some truths that are beyond doubt, such as the existence and goodness
  of God; but on other religious topics no one can be sufficiently certain
  so as to be justified in killing another man as a heretic. Castellio, in
  his time, was a lone voice; but later supporters of toleration looked back
  to him as a forerunner.
* *Apology for Raimond Sebond* (1569) by Michel Eyquem de Montaigne became
  the classic modern statement of skepticism. The *Apology* contains much
  more than a rehearsal of ancient skeptical arguments. Prior to presenting
  them, Montaigne works hard to induce in his reader a proper degree of
  intellectual humility. He argues that animals, no less than humans, have
  feelings, thoughts, and virtues. The two spheres in which above all humans
  plume themselves on their unique gifts are religion and philosophy.
  Montaigne shows that humans can take little pride in their theological
  beliefs and activities, given the variety of contradictory doctrines on
  offer, and given the often debasing nature of religious practices. As for
  philosophy, he has no difficulty at all in showing that there has never
  been a philosopher whose system has been able to withstand the criticism
  of other philosophers.
* Montaigne's deflation of human nature in *Raimond Sebond* is the
  antithesis of the glorification of mankind in Pico della Mirondola's 1486
  *On the dignity of man*. The optimism generated by the rediscovery of
  classical texts and the exuberance of the visual arts in Renaissance
  Florence gave way to the pessimism natural in a Counter-Reformation France
  torn by sectarian warfare.
* To reconcile his skepticism with his orthodoxy, Montaigne emphasizes that
  what he has been attacking are the pretensions of the human intellect to
  achieve truth by its own efforts. But faith is not an achievement, it is a
  free gift from God.

## Counter-Reformation philosophy

* Montaigne's exaltation of revelation to the exclusion of reason—‘fideism’
  as it came to be called—was not typical of the Counter-Reformation. In
  reaction against Luther's insistence that the human intellect and will had
  been totally corrupted by the sin of Adam, Catholic controversialists
  tended to emphasize that basic religious truths were within the scope of
  unaided human intellect, and that faith itself needed the support and
  defense of reason.
* In the forefront of this optimistic thrust of the Counter-Reformation were
  the Jesuits, the members of the new Society of Jesus. The order was
  founded by the Spanish ex-soldier Ignatius Loyola and was approved by Pope
  Paul III in 1540. In addition to the vows of poverty, chastity, and
  obedience taken by all members of religious orders, the Jesuits took a
  further vow of unquestioning loyalty to the papacy. Its members soon
  distinguished themselves in educational and missionary work in many parts
  of the world. In philosophy and theology in the universities they were
  soon able to compete with the long-established religious orders such as
  the Franciscans and Dominicans.
* Whereas medieval scholastics had based their university lectures upon
  canonical texts such as the works of Aristotle and the Sentences of Peter
  Lombard, Jesuits in universities began to replace commentaries with
  self-standing courses in philosophy and theology. By the early seventeenth
  century this pattern was adopted by Dominicans and Franciscans, and this
  led to a sharper distinction between philosophy and theology than had been
  common earlier.
* Of the philosophical issues dividing the Catholic and Protestant camps in
  the sixteenth century none was more thorny than human free will, which had
  been proclaimed at the Council of Trent in opposition no Lutheran
  determinism and Calvinist predestination. The Jesuits made themselves
  champions of the libertarian account of human freedom. Francisco Suarez
  and his Jesuit colleague Luis de Molina offered a definition of free
  agency in terms of the availability of alternative courses of
  action—‘liberty of indifference’ as it came to be known. ‘That agent is
  called free which in the presence of all necessary conditions for action
  can act and refrain from action or can do one thing while being able to do
  its opposite.’
* Such a definition did ample justice to humans' consciousness of their own
  choices and their attribution of responsibility to others. But by
  comparison with more restrictive accounts of freedom, at made it very
  difficult to account for God's foreknowledge of free human actions, to
  which both Catholics and Protestants were committed. Molina, in his famous
  *Concordia* (1589), presented an elaborate solution to the problem, in
  terms of God's comprehensive knowledge of the actions of every possible
  human being in every possible world. Ingenious though it was, Molina's
  solution was unpopular not only among Protestians but also among his
  Catholic co-religionists.

## Giordano Bruno

* Two features of Bruno's system have caught the attention of historians and
  scientists: his adoption of the Copernican hypothesis, and his postulation
  of multiple universes. Bruno accepted that it was the earth that went
  round the sun, and not the sun that went round the earth. He went on to
  develop Copernicus' ideas in a bold and dramatic manner. The earth was not
  the center of the universe: but neither was the sun. Our sun is just one
  star among others, and in boundless space there are many solar systems. No
  sun or star can be called the center of the universe, because all
  positions are relative.

## Galileo

* Already as a young man Galileo had begun to criticize the still dominant
  physics of Aristotle, not, like Bruno, on the basis of Neoplatonic
  metaphysics, but as a result of observation and experiment.
* On its own, Galileo's work in mechanics would entitle him to a place among
  the great scientists, and he also made important discoveries in
  hydrostatics. But it was his research into astronomy that brought him fame
  and tribulation. Using the newly invented telescope, which he himself
  substantially improved, he was able to observe four moons of Jupiter. He
  discovered the mountains of the moon and the variable spots on the sun;
  discoveries which showed that the heavenly bodies were not, as Aristotle
  thought, made out of a uniform crystalline quintessence, but consisted of
  the same sort of material as our own earth.
* Shortly afterwards, Galileo observed that the planet Venus wen through
  phases similar to the phases of the moon. This could only be explained, he
  concluded, if Venus was orbiting the sun and not the earth: it provided a
  powerful argument in favor of the Copernican hypothesis. The discovery of
  the moons that revolved around Jupiter in its planetary orbit had already
  disposed of one the strongest arguments urged against heliocentrism,
  namely that the moon would only be able to orbit the earth if the earth
  itself was stationary.
* Galileo was advised by the Church not to hold heretical opinions. While
  Galileo's writings were not condemned, he was silenced for several years.
* In 1632 Galileo published, with the approval of the papal censor,
  *Dialogue on the two chief world systems*. In the book one character,
  Salviati, presents the Copernican system, and another, Simplicius, defends
  the traditional one. ‘Simplicius’ was an appropriate name for the defender
  of Aristatelianism, since it had been borne by the greatest of Aristotle's
  Greek commentators. However, it could also be interpreted as meaning
  ‘simpleton’ and the pope was furious when he found some of his own words
  placed in the month of Simplicius. He concluded that Galileo had presented
  the Copernican system in a more favorable light than its opponent, and had
  therefore deviated from the terms of his license to publish. In 1633
  Galileo was summoned to Rome, tried by the Inquisition, and under the
  threat of torture forced to abjure heliocentrism. He was condemned to life
  imprisonment, a sentence that he served out until dis death in 1642, in
  confinement in the houses of distinguished friends and eventually in his
  own home at Bellosguardo outside Florence.
* Galileo was treated more humanely than Bruno and many another prisoner of
  the Inquisition, but the evil effects of his condemnation were felt
  throughout Europe. Scientific investigation in Italy went into decline.
  When in 1992 Pope John Paul II publicly acknowledged the injustice the
  Church had done to Galileo, the apology came 350 years too late.

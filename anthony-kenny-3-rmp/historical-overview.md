# Historical overview

## Humanism and reform

* Erasmus, More, and their friends propounded in Northern Europe the
  humanist ideas that had taken root in Italy in the previous century.
  ‘Humanism’ at that time did not mean a desire to replace religious values
  with secular human ones: Erasmus was a priest who wrote best-selling works
  of piety, and More was later martyred for his religious beliefs.
  Humanists, rather, were people who believed in the educational value of
  the ‘humane letters’ (*literae humaniores*) of the Greek and Latin
  classics.
* Humanists valued grammar, philology, and rhetoric more highly than the
  technical philosophical studies that had preoccupied scholars during the
  Middle Ages. They despised the Latin that had been the lingua franca of
  medieval universities.
* Erasmus was more interested in divinity than in philosophy, and he cared
  more for biblical studies than for speculative theology. Scholastics like
  Scotus and Ockham, he complained, merely choked with brambles paths that
  had been made plain by earlier thinkers.
* Luther was an Augustinian monk, as Erasmus had been until released by
  papal dispensation from his monastic commitments. Like Erasmus, Luther had
  made a close study of St Paul's Epistle to the Romans. This had made him
  question fundamentally the ethos of Renaissance Catholicism. The year
  after the publication of Erasmus' New Testament Luther issued, in the
  University of Wittenberg, a public denunciation of abuses of papal
  authority, in particular of a scandalously promoted offer of an indulgence
  in return for contributions to the building of the great new church of St
  Peters' in Rome.
* In 1520 Pope Leo X condemned forty-one articles taken from Luther's
  teaching, and followed this up with an excommunication after Luther had
  burnt the Bull of Condemnation.

## Sin, grace, and freedom

* Adrian VI urged Erasmus to take up his pen against the reformers. The
  ground Erasmus chose for battle was Luther's position on the freedom of
  the will. Philosophically, Erasmus is unsubtle. He refers to, but does not
  improve upon, Valla's dialogue on free will. He repeats commonplaces of
  centuries of scholastic debate which are inadequate responses to the
  problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge with human freedom—he insists,
  for instance, that even humans know many things that will happen in the
  future, such as eclipses of the sun. A theory of free will that leaves us
  no freer than the starts in their courses is not a very robust answer to
  Luther.
* Luther the opinion that the Council of Constance ascribed to Wyclif: that
  everything happens of ‘necessity’. He distinguishes, however, between two
  senses of ‘necessity’. The human will is subject to ‘necessity of
  immutability’: it has no power to change itself from its innate desire for
  evil. But it is not subject to another form of necessity, namely
  compulsion: a human being lacking grace does evil spontaneously and
  willingly. The human will is like a beast of burden: if God rides it, it
  wills and goes where God wills; if Satan rides it, it goes where Satan
  wills. It has no freedom to choose its rider.
* Luther prefers to abandon altogether the term ‘free will’; other writers,
  before and after, have regarded the spontaneity that he accepts as being
  the only thing that can genuinely be meant by the term. Luther's principal
  concern was to deny free will in matters that make the difference between
  salvation and damnation. In other cases he seems to allow the possibility
  of genuine choice between alternative courses of action. Humans have free
  will in respect not of what is above them, but in respect of what is below
  them. The sinner, for instance, can make his choice between a variety of
  sins.
* From a philosophical point of view these early Reformation debates on
  freedom and determinism do no more than rehearse arguments which were
  commonplaces of ancient and medieval philosophy. They illustrate, however,
  the negative side of humanist education. Scholastic debates, if sometimes
  arid, had commonly been sober and courteous. Thomas Aquinas', for
  instance, was always anxious to put the best possible interpretation on
  the theses of those he disagreed with. Erasmus shared something of
  Aquinas' eirenic spirit; but More and Luther attack each other with bitter
  vituperation made only the more vulgar by the elegant Latin in which it is
  phrased. The pugnacious conventions of humanist debate were a factor which
  led to the hardening of positions on either side of the Reformation
  divide.

## Authority and conscience

* Luther introduced a general hostility not just to scholasticism but to
  philosophy itself. He denounced Aristotle, and in particular his *Ethics*,
  as ‘the vilest enemy of grace’. His contempt for the powers of unaided
  reason was the outcome of his belief that in Adam's fall human nature had
  become totally corrupt and impotent.
* Pessimism about the moral capacity of the trained intellect unaided by
  grace went hand in hand with optimism about the intellectual ability of
  the untrained mind illumined by faith. Squeezed between the two,
  philosophy found its role greatly diminished among devout Protestants.
* In Rome Pope Paul III (1534-9) promoted a Counter-Reformation, instituting
  a new religious order of Jesuits, and convening a Council at Tent to
  reform Church discipline. The council condemned the Lutheran doctrine of
  justification by faith alone, and the Calvinist doctrine that God
  predestined the wicked to hell prior to any sin. Free will, it insisted,
  had not been extinguished by Adam's fall. It reaffirmed the doctrine of
  transubstantiation and the traditional seven sacraments. By the time the
  council had finished its work, in 1563, Luther was dead and Calvin was
  dying.

## The decline of logic

* The combined effects of the Renaissance and the Reformation made the
  sixteenth century a barren one in most areas of philosophy. Logic was
  perhaps the branch of philosophy that suffered most severely. Logic did
  continue to be taught in the universities, but humanist scholars were
  impatient of it, regarding its terminology as barbarous and its
  complexities as pettifogging.

## Skepticism, sacred and profane

* Sebastian Castellio wrote *Whether Heretics are to be persecuted* (1554)
  in which he pleaded in favor of toleration. His arguments are mainly
  quotations of authoritative texts or appeals to the example of Christ. In
  a later work, *The art of doubting*, Castellio developed more
  epistemological arguments. The difficulty of interpreting Scripture, and
  the variety of opinions among Christian sects, should make us very
  cautious in laying down the law on religious matters. To be sure, there
  are some truths that are beyond doubt, such as the existence and goodness
  of God; but on other religious topics no one can be sufficiently certain
  so as to be justified in killing another man as a heretic. Castellio, in
  his time, was a lone voice; but later supporters of toleration looked back
  to him as a forerunner.
* *Apology for Raimond Sebond* (1569) by Michel Eyquem de Montaigne became
  the classic modern statement of skepticism. The *Apology* contains much
  more than a rehearsal of ancient skeptical arguments. Prior to presenting
  them, Montaigne works hard to induce in his reader a proper degree of
  intellectual humility. He argues that animals, no less than humans, have
  feelings, thoughts, and virtues. The two spheres in which above all humans
  plume themselves on their unique gifts are religion and philosophy.
  Montaigne shows that humans can take little pride in their theological
  beliefs and activities, given the variety of contradictory doctrines on
  offer, and given the often debasing nature of religious practices. As for
  philosophy, he has no difficulty at all in showing that there has never
  been a philosopher whose system has been able to withstand the criticism
  of other philosophers.
* Montaigne's deflation of human nature in *Raimond Sebond* is the
  antithesis of the glorification of mankind in Pico della Mirondola's 1486
  *On the dignity of man*. The optimism generated by the rediscovery of
  classical texts and the exuberance of the visual arts in Renaissance
  Florence gave way to the pessimism natural in a Counter-Reformation France
  torn by sectarian warfare.
* To reconcile his skepticism with his orthodoxy, Montaigne emphasizes that
  what he has been attacking are the pretensions of the human intellect to
  achieve truth by its own efforts. But faith is not an achievement, it is a
  free gift from God.

## Counter-Reformation philosophy

* Montaigne's exaltation of revelation to the exclusion of reason—‘fideism’
  as it came to be called—was not typical of the Counter-Reformation. In
  reaction against Luther's insistence that the human intellect and will had
  been totally corrupted by the sin of Adam, Catholic controversialists
  tended to emphasize that basic religious truths were within the scope of
  unaided human intellect, and that faith itself needed the support and
  defense of reason.
* In the forefront of this optimistic thrust of the Counter-Reformation were
  the Jesuits, the members of the new Society of Jesus. The order was
  founded by the Spanish ex-soldier Ignatius Loyola and was approved by Pope
  Paul III in 1540. In addition to the vows of poverty, chastity, and
  obedience taken by all members of religious orders, the Jesuits took a
  further vow of unquestioning loyalty to the papacy. Its members soon
  distinguished themselves in educational and missionary work in many parts
  of the world. In philosophy and theology in the universities they were
  soon able to compete with the long-established religious orders such as
  the Franciscans and Dominicans.
* Whereas medieval scholastics had based their university lectures upon
  canonical texts such as the works of Aristotle and the Sentences of Peter
  Lombard, Jesuits in universities began to replace commentaries with
  self-standing courses in philosophy and theology. By the early seventeenth
  century this pattern was adopted by Dominicans and Franciscans, and this
  led to a sharper distinction between philosophy and theology than had been
  common earlier.
* Of the philosophical issues dividing the Catholic and Protestant camps in
  the sixteenth century none was more thorny than human free will, which had
  been proclaimed at the Council of Trent in opposition no Lutheran
  determinism and Calvinist predestination. The Jesuits made themselves
  champions of the libertarian account of human freedom. Francisco Suarez
  and his Jesuit colleague Luis de Molina offered a definition of free
  agency in terms of the availability of alternative courses of
  action—‘liberty of indifference’ as it came to be known. ‘That agent is
  called free which in the presence of all necessary conditions for action
  can act and refrain from action or can do one thing while being able to do
  its opposite.’
* Such a definition did ample justice to humans' consciousness of their own
  choices and their attribution of responsibility to others. But by
  comparison with more restrictive accounts of freedom, at made it very
  difficult to account for God's foreknowledge of free human actions, to
  which both Catholics and Protestants were committed. Molina, in his famous
  *Concordia* (1589), presented an elaborate solution to the problem, in
  terms of God's comprehensive knowledge of the actions of every possible
  human being in every possible world. Ingenious though it was, Molina's
  solution was unpopular not only among Protestians but also among his
  Catholic co-religionists.

## Giordano Bruno

* Two features of Bruno's system have caught the attention of historians and
  scientists: his adoption of the Copernican hypothesis, and his postulation
  of multiple universes. Bruno accepted that it was the earth that went
  round the sun, and not the sun that went round the earth. He went on to
  develop Copernicus' ideas in a bold and dramatic manner. The earth was not
  the center of the universe: but neither was the sun. Our sun is just one
  star among others, and in boundless space there are many solar systems. No
  sun or star can be called the center of the universe, because all
  positions are relative.

## Galileo

* Already as a young man Galileo had begun to criticize the still dominant
  physics of Aristotle, not, like Bruno, on the basis of Neoplatonic
  metaphysics, but as a result of observation and experiment.
* On its own, Galileo's work in mechanics would entitle him to a place among
  the great scientists, and he also made important discoveries in
  hydrostatics. But it was his research into astronomy that brought him fame
  and tribulation. Using the newly invented telescope, which he himself
  substantially improved, he was able to observe four moons of Jupiter. He
  discovered the mountains of the moon and the variable spots on the sun;
  discoveries which showed that the heavenly bodies were not, as Aristotle
  thought, made out of a uniform crystalline quintessence, but consisted of
  the same sort of material as our own earth.
* Shortly afterwards, Galileo observed that the planet Venus wen through
  phases similar to the phases of the moon. This could only be explained, he
  concluded, if Venus was orbiting the sun and not the earth: it provided a
  powerful argument in favor of the Copernican hypothesis. The discovery of
  the moons that revolved around Jupiter in its planetary orbit had already
  disposed of one the strongest arguments urged against heliocentrism,
  namely that the moon would only be able to orbit the earth if the earth
  itself was stationary.
* Galileo was advised by the Church not to hold heretical opinions. While
  Galileo's writings were not condemned, he was silenced for several years.
* In 1632 Galileo published, with the approval of the papal censor,
  *Dialogue on the two chief world systems*. In the book one character,
  Salviati, presents the Copernican system, and another, Simplicius, defends
  the traditional one. ‘Simplicius’ was an appropriate name for the defender
  of Aristatelianism, since it had been borne by the greatest of Aristotle's
  Greek commentators. However, it could also be interpreted as meaning
  ‘simpleton’ and the pope was furious when he found some of his own words
  placed in the month of Simplicius. He concluded that Galileo had presented
  the Copernican system in a more favorable light than its opponent, and had
  therefore deviated from the terms of his license to publish. In 1633
  Galileo was summoned to Rome, tried by the Inquisition, and under the
  threat of torture forced to abjure heliocentrism. He was condemned to life
  imprisonment, a sentence that he served out until dis death in 1642, in
  confinement in the houses of distinguished friends and eventually in his
  own home at Bellosguardo outside Florence.
* Galileo was treated more humanely than Bruno and many another prisoner of
  the Inquisition, but the evil effects of his condemnation were felt
  throughout Europe. Scientific investigation in Italy went into decline.
  When in 1992 Pope John Paul II publicly acknowledged the injustice the
  Church had done to Galileo, the apology came 350 years too late.

## Bacon

* An English contemporary of Galileo, Francis Bacon, shared his antipathy to
  Aristotle, but was more interested in the theory than in the practice of
  scientific method. Born in London in 1561, Bacon was educated at Trinity
  College, Cambridge, and studied law at Gray's Inn. He entered Parliament
  in 1584 and later became a client of Queen Elizabeth's favorite, the Earl
  of Essex. When, in 1598, Essex plotted an insurrection, Bacon took a
  leading part in his prosecution for treason. On the accession of James I
  he became solicitor-general and was knighted. In 1606 he published the
  first of major philosophical writing, *The Advancement of Learning*, a
  systematic classification of scientific disciplines.
* The climax of Bacon's career was his appointment in 1618 as Lord
  Chancellor with the title Lord Verulam. He planned a massive work, the
  *Instauratio Magna (The Great Instauration)*, which was to take all
  knowledge for its province. Only two parts of this were completed: the
  first was a revision of *The Advancement of Learning*, and the second was
  the *Novum Organum* which was his principal work on scientific method. In
  1621, in the course of a parliamentary inquiry, he pleaded guilty to
  changes of accepting bribes, and was disgraced and briefly imprisoned. He
  wrote other scientific and historical works and also the essays for which
  he is nowadays best remembered. He died at Highgate in 1626.

## Descartes

* Born in 1596 in a village in Touraine.
* In the wars of religion that divided Europe, he enlisted in both camps.
  First, he was an unpaid volunteer in the army of the Protestant Prince of
  Orange; later he served in the army of the Catholic Duke Maximilian of
  Bavaria, who was then at war with the Palatine Elector Frederick,
  son-in-law of King James I of Britain. After he left the army he did not
  adopt a profession. Unlike the great philosophers of the Middle Ages he
  was a layman in both ecclesiastical and the academic sense. He never
  lectured in a university, and he lived a private life as a gentleman of
  means. He wrote his most famous work not in the Latin of the learned
  world, but in good plain French, so that it could be understood, as he put
  it, ‘even by women’.
* There are two key ideas that are presented in the *Discourse* and
  elaborated in later works. First: human beings are thinking substances.
  Second: matter is extension in motion. Everything in his system is to be
  explained in terms of this dualism of mind and matter. If we nowadays tend
  naturally to think of mind and matter as the two great mutually exclusive
  and mutually exhaustive divisions of the universe we inhabit, that is
  because of Descartes.
* Descartes reaches these conclusions by the application of a method of
  systematic doubt. To prevent being ensnared in falsehood, the philosopher
  must begin by doubting whatever can be doubted. The senses sometimes
  deceive us; mathematicians sometimes make mistakes; we can never be
  certain whether we are awake or asleep. Accordingly:
  > I decided to feign that everything that had entered my mind hitherto was
  > no more true than the illusions of dreams. But immediately upon this I
  > noticed that while I was trying to think everything false, it must needs
  > be that I, who was thinking this, was something. And observing that this
  > truth ‘I am thinking, therefore I exist’ was so solid and secure that
  > the most extravagant suppositions of skeptics could not overthrow it, I
  > judged that I need not scruple to accept it as the first principle of
  > philosophy that I was seeking.
* This is the famous *Cognito, ergo sum*, which archives the second task of
  the philosopher (MK: what is the first?), that of preventing the
  systematic doubt from leading to skepticism. But from it Descartes goes on
  to derive the principles of his system. If I were not thinking, I would
  have no reason to believe that I existed (MK: could something incapable of
  thinking believe?); hence I am a substance whose whole essence is to
  think; being a body is no part of my essence. The same goes for every
  other human being. So Descartes' first main thesis is established.
* What assures me that the *Cognito* is correct? Only that I see clearly
  that it is true. Whenever I conceive something clearly and distinctly, I
  am assured of its truth (MK: so much for systematic doubt!). But when we
  turn to material objects, we find that of all their properties the only
  ones we clearly and distinctly perceive are shape, size, and movement. So
  Descartes gains his second main thesis, that matter is extension in motion.
* What guarantees the principle that whatever I see clearly and distinctly
  is true? Only the truthful nature of the God to whom I owe my existence as
  a thinking thing (MK: good God is no deceiver!). So establishing the
  existence of God is a necessary part of Descartes' system. He offers two
  proofs that there is a God. First, I have in myself the idea of a perfect
  being, and this idea cannot be caused in me by anything less than a being
  that is itself perfect. Second, to be perfect a being must include in
  itself all perfections; but existence is a perfection, and therefore a
  perfect being must exist. MK: this is so wrong I won't spend time
  attacking it here.
* Descartes initiated a new, individualistic, style of philosophizing.
  Medieval philosophers had seen themselves as principally engaged in
  transmitting a corpus of knowledge; in the course of transmission they
  might offer improvements, but these must remain within the bounds set by
  tradition. Renaissance philosophers had seen themselves as rediscovering
  and republicizing the lost wisdom of ancient times. It was Descartes who
  was the first philosopher since Antiquity to offer himself as a total
  innovator; as the person who had the privilege of setting out the truth
  about man and his universe for the very first time. Where Descartes trod,
  others followed: Locke, Hume, and Kant each offered their philosophies as
  new creations, constructed for the first time on sound scientific
  principles. ‘Read my work, and discard my predecessors’ is a constant
  theme of 17th and 18th-century thinkers and writers.
* With medieval philosophers like Aquinas, Scotus, and Ockham, a student has
  to read the texts closely to realize the great degree of innovation that
  is going on: the new wine is always decanted so carefully into the old
  bottles. With Descartes and his successors, the difficulty is the
  opposite: one has to look outside the text to realize that much that is
  presented as original insight is in fact to be found stated in earlier
  authors. There is no need to doubt the sincerity of Descartes' repeated
  statements that he owed nothing to his scholastic predecessors. He was not
  a plagiarist, but he had no appreciation of how much he had imbibed from
  the intellectual atmosphere in which he grew up.
* When Descartes tried to doubt everything, the one thing he did not call
  into question was the meaning of the words he was using in his solitary
  meditation. Had he done so, he would have had to realize that even the
  words we use in soliloquy derive their meaning from the social community
  which is the home of our language, and therefore it was not, in fact,
  possible to build up his philosophy from solitary private ideas. Again,
  Descartes thought that it was not possible to call into question
  propositions that he was taught by natural light—the clear and distinct
  perceptions that form the basic building blocks of his system. But in
  fact, too often when he tells us that something is taught by the natural
  light in our solus, he produces a doctrine that he had imbibed from the
  Jesuits at La Flèche.
* There is no doubt of the enormous influence Descartes has exercised from
  his own day to ours. But his relation to modern philosophy is not that of
  father to son, nor of architect to palace, nor of planner to city. Rather,
  in the history of philosophy his position is like that of the waist of an
  hourglass. As the sand in the upper chamber of such a glass reaches its
  lower chamber only through the slender passage between the two, so too
  ideas that had their origin in the Middle Ages have reached the modern
  world through a narrow filter: the compressing genius of Descartes.

## Hobbes

* Descartes and Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) had much in common. They shared a
  contempt for Aristotle and the Aristotelian establishment in the
  universities. Both were solitary thinkers who spent significant parts of
  their lives in exile—each, for a time, beholden to banished Stuart courts.
  Both of them had very modest libraries, and were contemptuous of
  book-learning. Hobbes, like Descartes, was a master of vernacular prose,
  and wrote for popular reading as well as for the learned world.
* The most significant philosophical agreement between the two men was that
  each of them was convinced that the material world was to be explained
  solely in terms of motion. ‘The causes of universal things (of those, at
  least, that have any cause) are manifest of themselves, or (as they say
  commonly) known to nature; so that they need no method at all; for hey
  have all but one universal cause, which is motion,’ wrote Hobbes. Like
  Descartes, Hobbes denied the objective reality of secondary properties
  such as color, sound, and heat, and indeed of all real accidents.
* However, while Hobbes was close to one half of Descartes' philosophy, his
  philosophy of matter, he was strongly opposed to the other half, his
  philosophy of mind. Indeed he denied the existence of mind in the sense in
  which Descartes understood it.There was, for Hobbes, no such thing as a
  non-bodily substance, unextended and unmoving. There were no incorporeal
  spirits, human, angelic, or divine. The very expression ‘incorporeal
  substance’, he said, was as absurd as ‘round quadrangle’. Historians
  disagree whether Hobbes' materialism involved a denial of the existence of
  God, or implied that God was a body of some infinite and invisible kind.
  It is unlikely that he was an atheist; but he certainly denied the dualism
  of mind and matter in human beings.
* In *Leviathan, or the Matter, Form and Power of a Commonwealth
  Ecclesiastical and Civil* Hobbes argues that principles of rational
  self-interest would urge men to give up some of their unfettered liberty
  in return for equal concessions by others. Such principles would lead them
  to transfer their rights, save that of self-defense, to a central power
  able to enforce laws by punishment. A covenant of every man with every man
  sets up a supreme sovereign, himself not a party to the covenant and
  therefore incapable of breaching it. Such a sovereign is the source of law
  and property rights, and it is his function to enforce, not just the
  original covenant that constitutes the state, but individual covenants
  that his subjects make with each other.
* Hobbes' fame in the history of philosophy rests above all on his
  contribution to political philosophy. He himself, however, attached great
  importance to his philosophy of language. The invention of printing, he
  observes, was no great matter compared with the invention of writing, and
  that in its turn is insignificant compared to the invention of speech,
  which is what marks us off from beasts and makes us capable of pursuing
  science. Without words ‘there had been amongst men, neither commonwealth,
  nor society, nor contract, nor peace, no more than amongst lions, bears,
  and wolves.’
* Hobbes is a thoroughgoing nominalist: all words are names, and names refer
  only to individuals. Names may be proper, such as ‘Peter’, or common, such
  as ‘horse’; and they may also be abstract, such as ‘life’ or ‘length’.
  Universal names like ‘man’ and ‘tree’ do not name any universal thing in
  the world or any idea in the mind, but name many individuals. For Hobbes,
  names are put together to make sentences. If we say ‘Socrates is just’,
  the semantic relationship of the word ‘just’ to the man Socrates is
  exactly the same as the relationship of the word ‘Socrates’: both are
  names, and the predicate term in the sentence signifies in the same way as
  the subject term does. Sentences are true when the two names they contain
  are both names of the same thing. ‘A man is a living creature’ is true
  because ‘living creature’ is a name of everything that is signified by
  ‘man’. ‘Every man is just’ is false because ‘just’ is not a name of every
  man, the greater part of mankind deserving the name ‘unjust’. The two-name
  theory is a naive piece of semantics which would not survive serious
  logical criticism such as it had received in the medieval period and as it
  was to receive in the 19th century in the work of Gottlob Frege. Hobbes'
  version of the theory is a particularly crude one by comparison with that
  of its leading medieval proponent, William Ockham. It remained
  influential, however, among the British empiricists whom many have seen as
  the heirs of the tradition of Ockham and Hobbes.

## The Cambridge Platonists

* A group of half a dozen English philosophers in the mid-17th century
  occupied a position at odds with both Hobbes and Descartes. Five of them,
  of whom the most important was Ralph Cudworth (1617-88), were graduates of
  Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and one of them, Henry More (1614-87), was a
  graduate of Christ's College, Cambridge, of which Cudworth was for thirty
  years master. All of them shared an admiration for Plato, Plotinus, and
  their followers among the early Church Fathers. Hence the group is
  commonly called the ‘Cambridge Platonists’.
* Despite their Cambridge affiliation, the members of the group were hostile
  to the Puritanism that prevailed in that town and university during the
  Civil War. They rejected Calvinist doctrines of predestination, affirmed
  human freedom, and preached the merits of religious toleration. Their
  toleration, however, did not extend to atheists, and the focus of their
  hostility was Hobbes, whose materialism they regarded as tantamount to
  atheism. During the reign of Charles I Puritan hostility to the Anglican
  hierarchy had been followed by the deposition and execution of the king.
  For the Cambridge Platonists the political slogan ‘No bishop, no king’ had
  a philosophical counterpart: ‘No spirit, no God’. One could not be
  materialist and a theist at the same time.
* Cambridge Platonists sided with Descartes against Hobbes in emphasizing
  the distinction of mind from matter. They devoted themselves to proving
  the immortality of the human soul and the existence of a spiritual God.
  For More, a human being is ‘a created spirit endowed with sense and
  reason, and a power of organizing terrestrial matter into human shape.’
  Like Descartes, Cudworth argues that God's existence can be proved by the
  presence is us of the idea of God: ‘Were there no God the idea of an
  absolutely or infinitely perfect Being could never have been made or
  feigned, neither by politicians, nor by poets, nor philosophers, nor any
  other.’ MK: why not? Clearly we can conceive of various things that do not
  exist if they are buildable from notions that we possess.
* The Cambridge Platonists parted company with Descartes when they came to
  explain the basis of fundamental ethical principles. It was quite wrong,
  Cudworth complained, to say that moral and other eternal truths depended
  on the omnipotent will of God and were therefore in principle variable.
  ‘Virtue and holiness in creatures’, he told the House of Commons in a 1647
  sermon, ‘are not therefore Good because God loves them, and will have them
  be accounted such; but rather, God therefore love them because they are in
  themselves simply good.’
* The Platonists' disagreement with Descartes was much sharper when they
  came to consider his account of the material world. They were not opposed
  to new developments in science—both Cudworth and More were members of the
  Royal Society—but they denied that the phenomena could be accounted for
  mechanistically in terms of matter and motion. Unlike Descartes, they
  believed that animals had consciousness and sensitive souls; and even the
  fall of a heavy body, they believed, needed to be explained by the action
  an immaterial principle. This did not mean that God did everything
  directly, as it were with his own hands, but rather that he had entrusted
  the physical world to an intermediary, ‘a plastic nature’ akin to a
  world-soul, that acted regularly and teleologically. Those like Descartes
  who rejected teleology were mere ‘mechanic theists’ and were little better
  than the materialist Hobbes.

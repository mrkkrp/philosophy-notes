## 1. Please don't feed the bugbears

* Dennett first asks why is it that we are so interested in the question of
  free will. He answers it by saying that we are afraid not to have free
  will. Yet, in our everyday life we are not much concerned by the question,
  so what is it that we are really afraid of? He insists that understanding
  this motivation is a prerequisite for giving a satisfying answer.

## 2. Making reason practical

* A recurring theme in the free will literature is the idea that true
  freedom of the will consists (or would consist) in complete subjugation of
  the will to the dictates of reason. MK: even though Dennett gives many
  quotes to highlight how popular this idea was in philosophy, I found it
  strange. If there is a perfect justification for everything then there
  would seem to be no place for freedom since all decisions would be already
  made. This seems to go so much contrary to the idea of liberty of
  indifference.
* Next, Dennett starts considering interests, since it is interests that
  make reasons possible. He proceeds from simplest ‘replicators’ who were
  the first creatures to have interests and then he arrives at the famous
  Sphex wasp who also has interests (and reasons) even though it does not
  seem to be consciously aware of them. It is this fact of it not being
  aware of its own interests that makes us interpret its behavior as dump
  and potentially devoid of free will.
* Consider, for instance, the set of reasons, composing what we may call a
  rationale, for deceptive coloration among insects. The rationale can be
  quite elaborate: the precise color and location of deceptive markings such
  as the “eye-spots” on the wings of many moths is “dictated” by reasons of
  some subtlety, drawing on the visual acuity and color sensitivity of the
  relevant predators, the probably location and posture of the moth at the
  critical moment, and many other factors. Such rationales, which
  pre-Darwinian thinkers were constrained to place in the mind of God the
  Creator, can now be seen to be, and to have always been, “free-floating”:
  a set of reasons that were appreciated by, thought out by, and rendered
  explicit by *no one*.
* Mother Nature abides by the “Need to know” principle (that is, the animals
  are only aware of reasons that they need to know about in order to
  survive), but we appreciate a contrary principle: our ideal is to be
  completely savvy, to be able to notice all the reasons that concern us.
  That is what it would be to be able to choose one's course of action
  always as reason dictated.
* Animals can “approximate” practical solutions that respond to their
  interests and reasons without performing e.g. mathematical calculations
  regarding a certain optimal way of behaving. But how might more advanced
  creatures such as ourselves be capable of responding directly to reasons?
  How is truly rational will possible?
* Reasons or meanings are not physical properties of things, therefore if
  physical properties of the world cause me to act, I'm ipso facto not
  acting out of reason. It looks like philosophers like Kant seriously fell
  for this kind of dualism: one can be moved *either* by natural causes *or*
  by reason.
* What are brains? They are meaning manipulators, information processors,
  or, as Dennett call them, *semantic engines*. At the same time they are
  physical organs. That means that in the end they are reacting to physical
  stimuli, responding only to structural or formal properties. According to
  the traditional distinction in linguistics, a sentence's form or syntax is
  one thing and its meaning or semantics is another. Now how does the brain
  manage to get semantics from syntax? It couldn't.
* Brains only approximate the behavior of the (ideal, pure) semantic engine.
* It is the ability to apply pattern recognition to its own function that
  constitutes a leap in brain activity.
* Thus, (1) the blind trial and error of Darwinian selection creates (2)
  organisms whose blind trial and error behavior is subjected to selection
  by reinforcement, creating (3) “learned” behaviors that generate a
  profusion of (4) learning opportunities from which (5) the most telling
  can be “blindly” but reliably selected, creating (6) a better-focused
  capacity to generate (7) further candidates for not-so-blind
  “consideration”, and (8) the eventual selection or choice or decision of a
  course of action “based on” these considerations. Eventually, the
  overpowering “illusion” is created that the system is actually responding
  directly to meanings.
* A system that can reflect on its own activities cannot reflect on all its
  activities at once. It may be able to reflect on its reflections on its
  reflections, but sooner or later it must run out of moves or room or time.
  Could there be a perfect self-watcher? Not a finite and nonmagical one.
  This is shown by the proof in computability theory that the “halting
  problem” has no solution: there is no program that can inspect any program
  and determine whether or not it contains infinite loops. Now is anything
  short of perfection good enough for us? If we are not perfect, then we
  are, indeed, a little bit sphexish. That would mean that *in principle* we
  could be put in a ludicrous situation where we manifested our marginal,
  otherwise invisible irrationality. But this should hardly come as a shock
  or disappointment. Which of us requires an argument from physical finitude
  and computability theory to convince us we are not perfect
  meaning-extractors?
* Dennett further examines what does it mean to be “caused” to do a certain
  thing (as in, being pushed by psychological determinants) and finds that
  this way of thinking of human behavior is oversimplified as it neglects
  the fact that people notice, learn, form beliefs from one moment to the
  other, so they are never like some kind of crude automaton. ‘People and
  higher animals are designed to be highly sensitive to virtually everything
  that happens around them. It is, in fact, utterly impossible to get an
  awake, normal human being into exactly the same “cognitive state” (let
  alone the same microphysical state) on two different occasions, simply
  because time passes and unless one is comatose or in some other sort of
  Rip Van Winkle state, one *notices* and hence is constantly changing.’
* Does *thinking about beliefs and desires*, this reflexive, meta-thinking,
  have to be conscious thinking, or could it be merely behavioral
  “thinking”—the sort of reflexive “information processing” a computer can
  accomplish, for instance? A lot would seem to hang on the answer, for some
  of our strongest intuitions about freedom hinge on consciousness.
* Could one be self-conscious, but only unconsciously self-conscious, or has
  the gulf between unconscious and conscious processes already been crossed
  once we have arrived at systems that are capable of treating some of their
  own internal “belief” and “desire” states as objects of “scrutiny”,
  running their pattern recognition mechanisms over them, and so forth? MK:
  not sure where Dennett was going with this, he simply says that
  ‘intuitions and feelings run high on this question’ and abandons the topic
  of unconscious self-consciousness saying that ‘whatever “genuine
  consciousness” or “real intentionality” comes to, it must lie at the
  reachable top of that pyramid of natural, physical processes’. As if
  unconscious processes are not natural and physical.
* Next, Dennett takes the opportunity to tell us a story of how
  consciousness could develop. It goes like this. First, there are a species
  of creatures who are social enough to have a kind of vocabulary of
  messages that they can exchange and a certain awareness of the context in
  which this or that message can be used. Then, one day, perhaps by
  accident, such a creature sends a messages and hears/perceives it itself.
  Since such a creature is also a potential receiver of messages of this
  sort, it would understand itself and try to answer the message. This could
  stir some associations that could help it to solve the problem at hand.
  This ability to talk to oneself develops and becomes consciousness.
* Next, Dennett talks about morality. Morality is a new set of reasons that
  is not directly dictated by nature and primitive needs of living
  organisms. E.g. altruism is not in our genes, it is a product of social
  living.
* Nietzsche: we need a critique of moral values, the value of these values
  themselves must just be called in question. Foot (1973) comments: “But how
  can one value values? The idea of such a thing is enough to make one's
  head spin.” Perhaps this is where the limit of our reason starts to
  manifest itself, that's where we start to reveal our sphexish streak.

## 3. Control and self-control

* What we fear—or at any rate a very important part of what we fear—in
  determinism is the prospect that determinism would rule out control, and
  we very definitely do not want to lose control or be out of control or be
  controlled by something or someone else—like a marionette or puppet. What
  we must do, then, is perform a long overdue bit of “ordinary language
  philosophy”, to see what we actually have in mind when we yearn for
  control and fear its loss.
* A controls B if and only if the relation between A and B is such that A
  can drive B into whichever of B's normal range of states A wants B to be
  in. For something to be controllee it just needs to have a variety of
  different states it can be in, but for something to be a controller its
  states must include desires—or something “like” desires—about the states
  of something else.
* Control can be verified empirically.
* Foreknowledge is what permits control.
* Control can be indirect. For example we can control Y by controlling X
  that controls Y. We can exercise control by introducing intentional
  changes to the environment of the thing we want to control, provided we
  know how that thing is going to react to the changes to the environment.
* Can we view the environment itself as a sort of minimal agent, and say
  that it does the controlling? Skinner: “We may disagree as to the nature
  or extent of the control which the world around us holds over us, but some
  control is obvious. Behavior must be appropriate to the occasion.” Thus
  Skinner would say that the goal of the NASA engineers was to design the
  explorer vehicles so that they would come to be controlled appropriately
  by the Martian world about them.
* Next, Dennett talks about what it would mean to be controlled by the
  environment in the “right” way, in “benevolent” way, etc. Finally, he
  rightly agrees that the environment per se does not exercise any control
  since it lacks any desires, so it is not an agent in that sense.
* Causation can be entirely inscrutable—utterly cost in a tangled web of
  coincidence—and still be causation. MK: it looks like Dennett wants to say
  that causation is not necessarily a reliable means of control?
* Laplace's superior intelligence would presumably fail to see the
  difference [between traceable and untraceable causation], and if offered a
  job at casino, would be just as capable of controlling a game of roulette
  as any billiards experts would be capable of controlling a game of
  billiards. Such a superhuman intelligence could also, no doubt, control
  one of us as easily as we control Sphex.
* We always want to have some elbow room, we plan in such a way to remain in
  control.
* If agent A is to control object B, A must solve the epistemic problem of
  identifying the parameters of B's operation. When two agents compete, each
  trying to control the other, there is thus competition for information,
  which each trying to conceal as much as possible about its own plans, its
  knowledge of the other's plans, and so forth, while obtaining as such
  “intelligence” as possible about the other. “If my opponent gets the edge,
  it may be able to find some way of treating me the way the biologist
  treated poor Sphex, some way of controlling my activity *in the wrong of
  sort of way*, a way that is contrary to my interests.”
* We are not so opposed to being controlled by an agent that only tells us
  the truth and provides argumentation of its entire evidence-gathering
  operation. But even then we might want first-hand access to the
  information in order to avoid being controlled by the way it is filtered.
* All things considered we are entitled to want a bit of “radical freedom”
  in order to remain in control, avoid being too fully understood.
* Counterbalancing the perennial persuasiveness of the ideal of freedom as
  *obeying the dictates of reason* is the subterranean unattractiveness of
  the selfsame idea. There seems in it no room for spontaneity, for whim,
  for individuality, for art.
* The apparent conflict (expressed by Rilke) between the ideal of
  spontaneity and the ideal of rational deliberation is an illusion. While
  no one of sound mind would choose a totally chaotic policy of decision and
  deliberation, it is equally true that the purest devotee of reason will be
  led, by that very devotion, to a policy that includes a fair measure of
  “letting yourself go” (MK: in order to made a decision when a proper
  analysis is not possible or would take too long, to behave in a less
  predictable way so as to avoid being controlled by others, etc.).
* Determinism in itself does not erode control. Deterministic systems are
  able to control themselves. If we are also deterministic systems, we need
  not on that account fear that we cannot be in control of ourselves and our
  destinies.
* The past does not control us. Casual links are not enough for control.
  There must be an agent with desires to exercise control and feedback for
  informing that agent.

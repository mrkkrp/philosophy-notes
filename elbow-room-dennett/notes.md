## 1. Please don't feed the bugbears

* Dennett first asks why is it that we are so interested in the question of
  free will. He answers it by saying that we are afraid not to have free
  will. Yet, in our everyday life we are not much concerned by the question,
  so what is it that we are really afraid of? He insists that understanding
  this motivation is a prerequisite for giving a satisfying answer.

## 2. Making reason practical

* A recurring theme in the free will literature is the idea that true
  freedom of the will consists (or would consist) in complete subjugation of
  the will to the dictates of reason. MK: even though Dennett gives many
  quotes to highlight how popular this idea was in philosophy, I found it
  strange. If there is a perfect justification for everything then there
  would seem to be no place for freedom—just do whatever makes sense. This
  seems to go so much contrary to the idea of liberty of indifference.
* Next, Dennett starts considering interests, since it is interests that
  make reasons possible. He proceeds from simplest ‘replicators’ who were
  the first creatures to have interests and then he arrives at the famous
  Sphex wasp who also has interests (and reasons) even though it does not
  seem to be consciously aware of them. It is this fact of it not being
  aware of its own interests that makes us interpret its behavior as dump
  and potentially devoid of free will.
* Consider, for instance, the set of reasons, composing what we may call a
  rationale, for deceptive coloration among insects. The rationale can be
  quite elaborate: the precise color and location of deceptive markings such
  as the “eye-spots” on the wings of many moths is “dictated” by reasons of
  some subtlety, drawing on the visual acuity and color sensitivity of the
  relevant predators, the probably location and posture of the moth at the
  critical moment, and many other factors. Such rationales, which
  pre-Darwinian thinkers were constrained to place in the mind of God the
  Creator, can now be seen to be, and to have always been, “free-floating”:
  a set of reasons that were appreciated by, thought out by, and rendered
  explicit by *no one*.
* Mother Nature abides by the “Need to know” principle, but we appreciate a
  contrary principle: our ideal is to be completely savvy, to be able to
  notice all the reasons that concern us. That is what it would be to be
  able to choose one's course of action always as reason dictated.
* Animals can “approximate” practical solutions that respond to their
  interests and reasons without performing e.g. mathematical calculations
  regarding a certain optimal way of behaving. But how might more advanced
  creatures such as ourselves be capable of responding directly to reasons?
  How is truly rational will possible?

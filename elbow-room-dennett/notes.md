## 1. Please don't feed the bugbears

* Dennett first asks why is it that we are so interested in the question of
  free will. He answers it by saying that we are afraid not to have free
  will. Yet, in our everyday life we are not much concerned by the question,
  so what is it that we are really afraid of? He insists that understanding
  this motivation is a prerequisite for giving a satisfying answer.

## 2. Making reason practical

* A recurring theme in the free will literature is the idea that true
  freedom of the will consists (or would consist) in complete subjugation of
  the will to the dictates of reason. MK: even though Dennett gives many
  quotes to highlight how popular this idea was in philosophy, I found it
  strange. If there is a perfect justification for everything then there
  would seem to be no place for freedom since all decisions would be already
  made. This seems to go so much contrary to the idea of liberty of
  indifference.
* Next, Dennett starts considering interests, since it is interests that
  make reasons possible. He proceeds from simplest ‘replicators’ who were
  the first creatures to have interests and then he arrives at the famous
  Sphex wasp who also has interests (and reasons) even though it does not
  seem to be consciously aware of them. It is this fact of it not being
  aware of its own interests that makes us interpret its behavior as dump
  and potentially devoid of free will.
* Consider, for instance, the set of reasons, composing what we may call a
  rationale, for deceptive coloration among insects. The rationale can be
  quite elaborate: the precise color and location of deceptive markings such
  as the “eye-spots” on the wings of many moths is “dictated” by reasons of
  some subtlety, drawing on the visual acuity and color sensitivity of the
  relevant predators, the probably location and posture of the moth at the
  critical moment, and many other factors. Such rationales, which
  pre-Darwinian thinkers were constrained to place in the mind of God the
  Creator, can now be seen to be, and to have always been, “free-floating”:
  a set of reasons that were appreciated by, thought out by, and rendered
  explicit by *no one*.
* Mother Nature abides by the “Need to know” principle (that is, the animals
  are only aware of reasons that they need to know about in order to
  survive), but we appreciate a contrary principle: our ideal is to be
  completely savvy, to be able to notice all the reasons that concern us.
  That is what it would be to be able to choose one's course of action
  always as reason dictated.
* Animals can “approximate” practical solutions that respond to their
  interests and reasons without performing e.g. mathematical calculations
  regarding a certain optimal way of behaving. But how might more advanced
  creatures such as ourselves be capable of responding directly to reasons?
  How is truly rational will possible?
* Reasons or meanings are not physical properties of things, therefore if
  physical properties of the world cause me to act, I'm ipso facto not
  acting out of reason. It looks like philosophers like Kant seriously fell
  for this kind of dualism: one can be moved *either* by natural causes *or*
  by reason.
* What are brains? They are meaning manipulators, information processors,
  or, as Dennett call them, *semantic engines*. At the same time they are
  physical organs. That means that in the end they are reacting to physical
  stimuli, responding only to structural or formal properties. According to
  the traditional distinction in linguistics, a sentence's form or syntax is
  one thing and its meaning or semantics is another. Now how does the brain
  manage to get semantics from syntax? It couldn't.
* Brains only approximate the behavior of the (ideal, pure) semantic engine.
* It is the ability to apply pattern recognition to its own function that
  constitutes a leap in brain activity.
* Thus, (1) the blind trial and error of Darwinian selection creates (2)
  organisms whose blind trial and error behavior is subjected to selection
  by reinforcement, creating (3) “learned” behaviors that generate a
  profusion of (4) learning opportunities from which (5) the most telling
  can be “blindly” but reliably selected, creating (6) a better-focused
  capacity to generate (7) further candidates for not-so-blind
  “consideration”, and (8) the eventual selection or choice or decision of a
  course of action “based on” these considerations. Eventually, the
  overpowering “illusion” is created that the system is actually responding
  directly to meanings.
* A system that can reflect on its own activities cannot reflect on all its
  activities at once. It may be able to reflect on its reflections on its
  reflections, but sooner or later it must run out of moves or room or time.
  Could there be a perfect self-watcher? Not a finite and nonmagical one.
  This is shown by the proof in computability theory that the “halting
  problem” has no solution: there is no program that can inspect any program
  and determine whether or not it contains infinite loops. Now is anything
  short of perfection good enough for us? If we are not perfect, then we
  are, indeed, a little bit sphexish. That would mean that *in principle* we
  could be put in a ludicrous situation where we manifested our marginal,
  otherwise invisible irrationality. But this should hardly come as a shock
  or disappointment. Which of us requires an argument from physical finitude
  and computability theory to convince us we are not perfect
  meaning-extractors?
* Dennett further examines what does it mean to be “caused” to do a certain
  thing (as in, being pushed by psychological determinants) and finds that
  this way of thinking of human behavior is oversimplified as it neglects
  the fact that people notice, learn, form beliefs from one moment to the
  other, so they are never like some kind of crude automaton. ‘People and
  higher animals are designed to be highly sensitive to virtually everything
  that happens around them. It is, in fact, utterly impossible to get an
  awake, normal human being into exactly the same “cognitive state” (let
  alone the same microphysical state) on two different occasions, simply
  because time passes and unless one is comatose or in some other sort of
  Rip Van Winkle state, one *notices* and hence is constantly changing.’

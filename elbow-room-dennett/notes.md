## 1. Please don't feed the bugbears

* Dennett first asks why is it that we are so interested in the question of
  free will. He answers it by saying that we are afraid not to have free
  will. Yet, in our everyday life we are not much concerned by the question,
  so what is it that we are really afraid of? He insists that understanding
  this motivation is a prerequisite for giving a satisfying answer.

## 2. Making reason practical

* A recurring theme in the free will literature is the idea that true
  freedom of the will consists (or would consist) in complete subjugation of
  the will to the dictates of reason. MK: even though Dennett gives many
  quotes to highlight how popular this idea was in philosophy, I found it
  strange. If there is a perfect justification for everything then there
  would seem to be no place for freedom since all decisions would be already
  made. This seems to go so much contrary to the idea of liberty of
  indifference.
* Next, Dennett starts considering interests, since it is interests that
  make reasons possible. He proceeds from simplest ‘replicators’ who were
  the first creatures to have interests and then he arrives at the famous
  Sphex wasp who also has interests (and reasons) even though it does not
  seem to be consciously aware of them. It is this fact of it not being
  aware of its own interests that makes us interpret its behavior as dump
  and potentially devoid of free will.
* Consider, for instance, the set of reasons, composing what we may call a
  rationale, for deceptive coloration among insects. The rationale can be
  quite elaborate: the precise color and location of deceptive markings such
  as the “eye-spots” on the wings of many moths is “dictated” by reasons of
  some subtlety, drawing on the visual acuity and color sensitivity of the
  relevant predators, the probably location and posture of the moth at the
  critical moment, and many other factors. Such rationales, which
  pre-Darwinian thinkers were constrained to place in the mind of God the
  Creator, can now be seen to be, and to have always been, “free-floating”:
  a set of reasons that were appreciated by, thought out by, and rendered
  explicit by *no one*.
* Mother Nature abides by the “Need to know” principle (that is, the animals
  are only aware of reasons that they need to know about in order to
  survive), but we appreciate a contrary principle: our ideal is to be
  completely savvy, to be able to notice all the reasons that concern us.
  That is what it would be to be able to choose one's course of action
  always as reason dictated.
* Animals can “approximate” practical solutions that respond to their
  interests and reasons without performing e.g. mathematical calculations
  regarding a certain optimal way of behaving. But how might more advanced
  creatures such as ourselves be capable of responding directly to reasons?
  How is truly rational will possible?
* Reasons or meanings are not physical properties of things, therefore if
  physical properties of the world cause me to act, I'm ipso facto not
  acting out of reason. It looks like philosophers like Kant seriously fell
  for this kind of dualism: one can be moved *either* by natural causes *or*
  by reason.
* What are brains? They are meaning manipulators, information processors,
  or, as Dennett call them, *semantic engines*. At the same time they are
  physical organs. That means that in the end they are reacting to physical
  stimuli, responding only to structural or formal properties. According to
  the traditional distinction in linguistics, a sentence's form or syntax is
  one thing and its meaning or semantics is another. Now how does the brain
  manage to get semantics from syntax? It couldn't.
* Brains only approximate the behavior of the (ideal, pure) semantic engine.
* It is the ability to apply pattern recognition to its own function that
  constitutes a leap in brain activity.
* Thus, (1) the blind trial and error of Darwinian selection creates (2)
  organisms whose blind trial and error behavior is subjected to selection
  by reinforcement, creating (3) “learned” behaviors that generate a
  profusion of (4) learning opportunities from which (5) the most telling
  can be “blindly” but reliably selected, creating (6) a better-focused
  capacity to generate (7) further candidates for not-so-blind
  “consideration”, and (8) the eventual selection or choice or decision of a
  course of action “based on” these considerations. Eventually, the
  overpowering “illusion” is created that the system is actually responding
  directly to meanings.
* A system that can reflect on its own activities cannot reflect on all its
  activities at once. It may be able to reflect on its reflections on its
  reflections, but sooner or later it must run out of moves or room or time.
  Could there be a perfect self-watcher? Not a finite and nonmagical one.
  This is shown by the proof in computability theory that the “halting
  problem” has no solution: there is no program that can inspect any program
  and determine whether or not it contains infinite loops. Now is anything
  short of perfection good enough for us? If we are not perfect, then we
  are, indeed, a little bit sphexish. That would mean that *in principle* we
  could be put in a ludicrous situation where we manifested our marginal,
  otherwise invisible irrationality. But this should hardly come as a shock
  or disappointment. Which of us requires an argument from physical finitude
  and computability theory to convince us we are not perfect
  meaning-extractors?
* Dennett further examines what does it mean to be “caused” to do a certain
  thing (as in, being pushed by psychological determinants) and finds that
  this way of thinking of human behavior is oversimplified as it neglects
  the fact that people notice, learn, form beliefs from one moment to the
  other, so they are never like some kind of crude automaton. ‘People and
  higher animals are designed to be highly sensitive to virtually everything
  that happens around them. It is, in fact, utterly impossible to get an
  awake, normal human being into exactly the same “cognitive state” (let
  alone the same microphysical state) on two different occasions, simply
  because time passes and unless one is comatose or in some other sort of
  Rip Van Winkle state, one *notices* and hence is constantly changing.’
* Does *thinking about beliefs and desires*, this reflexive, meta-thinking,
  have to be conscious thinking, or could it be merely behavioral
  “thinking”—the sort of reflexive “information processing” a computer can
  accomplish, for instance? A lot would seem to hang on the answer, for some
  of our strongest intuitions about freedom hinge on consciousness.
* Could one be self-conscious, but only unconsciously self-conscious, or has
  the gulf between unconscious and conscious processes already been crossed
  once we have arrived at systems that are capable of treating some of their
  own internal “belief” and “desire” states as objects of “scrutiny”,
  running their pattern recognition mechanisms over them, and so forth? MK:
  not sure where Dennett was going with this, he simply says that
  ‘intuitions and feelings run high on this question’ and abandons the topic
  of unconscious self-consciousness saying that ‘whatever “genuine
  consciousness” or “real intentionality” comes to, it must lie at the
  reachable top of that pyramid of natural, physical processes’. As if
  unconscious processes are not natural and physical.
* Next, Dennett takes the opportunity to tell us a story of how
  consciousness could develop. It goes like this. First, there are a species
  of creatures who are social enough to have a kind of vocabulary of
  messages that they can exchange and a certain awareness of the context in
  which this or that message can be used. Then, one day, perhaps by
  accident, such a creature sends a messages and hears/perceives it itself.
  Since such a creature is also a potential receiver of messages of this
  sort, it would understand itself and try to answer the message. This could
  stir some associations that could help it to solve the problem at hand.
  This ability to talk to oneself develops and becomes consciousness.
* Next, Dennett talks about morality. Morality is a new set of reasons that
  is not directly dictated by nature and primitive needs of living
  organisms. E.g. altruism is not in our genes, it is a product of social
  living.
* Nietzsche: we need a critique of moral values, the value of these values
  themselves must just be called in question. Foot (1973) comments: “But how
  can one value values? The idea of such a thing is enough to make one's
  head spin.” Perhaps this is where the limit of our reason starts to
  manifest itself, that's where we start to reveal our sphexish streak.

## 3. Control and self-control

* What we fear—or at any rate a very important part of what we fear—in
  determinism is the prospect that determinism would rule out control, and
  we very definitely do not want to lose control or be out of control or be
  controlled by something or someone else—like a marionette or puppet. What
  we must do, then, is perform a long overdue bit of “ordinary language
  philosophy”, to see what we actually have in mind when we yearn for
  control and fear its loss.
* A controls B if and only if the relation between A and B is such that A
  can drive B into whichever of B's normal range of states A wants B to be
  in. For something to be controllee it just needs to have a variety of
  different states it can be in, but for something to be a controller its
  states must include desires—or something “like” desires—about the states
  of something else.
* Control can be verified empirically.
* Foreknowledge is what permits control.
* Control can be indirect. For example we can control Y by controlling X
  that controls Y. We can exercise control by introducing intentional
  changes to the environment of the thing we want to control, provided we
  know how that thing is going to react to the changes to the environment.
* Can we view the environment itself as a sort of minimal agent, and say
  that it does the controlling? Skinner: “We may disagree as to the nature
  or extent of the control which the world around us holds over us, but some
  control is obvious. Behavior must be appropriate to the occasion.” Thus
  Skinner would say that the goal of the NASA engineers was to design the
  explorer vehicles so that they would come to be controlled appropriately
  by the Martian world about them.
* Next, Dennett talks about what it would mean to be controlled by the
  environment in the “right” way, in “benevolent” way, etc. Finally, he
  rightly agrees that the environment per se does not exercise any control
  since it lacks any desires, so it is not an agent in that sense.
* Causation can be entirely inscrutable—utterly cost in a tangled web of
  coincidence—and still be causation. MK: it looks like Dennett wants to say
  that causation is not necessarily a reliable means of control?
* Laplace's superior intelligence would presumably fail to see the
  difference [between traceable and untraceable causation], and if offered a
  job at casino, would be just as capable of controlling a game of roulette
  as any billiards experts would be capable of controlling a game of
  billiards. Such a superhuman intelligence could also, no doubt, control
  one of us as easily as we control Sphex.
* We always want to have some elbow room, we plan in such a way to remain in
  control.
* If agent A is to control object B, A must solve the epistemic problem of
  identifying the parameters of B's operation. When two agents compete, each
  trying to control the other, there is thus competition for information,
  which each trying to conceal as much as possible about its own plans, its
  knowledge of the other's plans, and so forth, while obtaining as such
  “intelligence” as possible about the other. “If my opponent gets the edge,
  it may be able to find some way of treating me the way the biologist
  treated poor Sphex, some way of controlling my activity *in the wrong of
  sort of way*, a way that is contrary to my interests.”
* We are not so opposed to being controlled by an agent that only tells us
  the truth and provides argumentation of its entire evidence-gathering
  operation. But even then we might want first-hand access to the
  information in order to avoid being controlled by the way it is filtered.
* All things considered we are entitled to want a bit of “radical freedom”
  in order to remain in control, avoid being too fully understood.
* Counterbalancing the perennial persuasiveness of the ideal of freedom as
  *obeying the dictates of reason* is the subterranean unattractiveness of
  the selfsame idea. There seems in it no room for spontaneity, for whim,
  for individuality, for art.
* The apparent conflict (expressed by Rilke) between the ideal of
  spontaneity and the ideal of rational deliberation is an illusion. While
  no one of sound mind would choose a totally chaotic policy of decision and
  deliberation, it is equally true that the purest devotee of reason will be
  led, by that very devotion, to a policy that includes a fair measure of
  “letting yourself go” (MK: in order to made a decision when a proper
  analysis is not possible or would take too long, to behave in a less
  predictable way so as to avoid being controlled by others, etc.).
* Determinism in itself does not erode control. Deterministic systems are
  able to control themselves. If we are also deterministic systems, we need
  not on that account fear that we cannot be in control of ourselves and our
  destinies.
* The past does not control us. Casual links are not enough for control.
  There must be an agent with desires to exercise control and feedback for
  informing that agent.

## 4. Self-made selves

* Do we *do* anything? What is it to be an agent, as opposed to a mere
  thread in the fabric of causation?
* Chisholm: If we are responsible… then we have a prerogative which some
  would attribute only to God: each of us, when we act, is a prime mover
  unmoved. In doing what we do, we cause certain events to happen, and
  nothing—or no one—causes us to cause those events to happen.
* Can we find a naturalistic account of the self or agent that avoids this
  “obscure and panicky metaphysics” while distinguishing agents sufficiently
  within the casual fabric?
* Whatever else we are, we are information-processing systems, and all
  information-processing systems rely on amplifiers of a sort. Relatively
  small causes are made to yield relatively large effects. In particular,
  the expenditure of large amounts of stored energy is controlled by
  modulation of lower-energy events. We see the dramatic effects leaving; we
  don't see the causes entering; we are tempted by the hypothesis that there
  are no causes.
* The invisibility of casual paths is not just a matter of the invisibility
  (to us) of other minds. From our own first-person “introspective” vantage
  point the casual paths are equally untraceable. When we decide our
  decision bubbles up to consciousness from we know not where.
* Is it not perhaps an illusion that I can grant or withhold acceptance of
  some proposition “at will”?
* Control is the ultimate criterion in defining self: I'm the sum total of
  the parts I control directly.
* Are all self-controllers selves?
* It would help us understand the difference between ourselves and lesser
  creatures if we had some developmental story to tell about the critical
  features in the intervening process that led from those lesser creatures
  to us.
* Edwards: Let us suppose that both A and B are compulsive and suffer
  intensely from their neuroses. Let us assume that there is a therapy that
  could help them, which could materially change their character structure,
  but that it takes a great deal of energy and courage to undertake the
  treatment. Let us suppose that A has the necessary energy and courage
  while B lacks it. A undergoes the therapy and changes in the desired way.
  B just gets more and more compulsive and more and more miserable. Now it
  is true that A helped form his own later character. But his starting
  point, his desire to change, his energy and courage, were already there.
  They may or may not have been the result of previous effects on his own
  part. But there must have been a first effort, and the effort at that time
  was the result of factors that were not of his making.
* I may not be controlled by the past, but my current capacity to make
  decisions and control myself is not, it seems, something I can take credit
  for. How could any deterministic process of “character transformation”
  beginning with a being that was *not* responsible for any of its
  “decisions” ever yield a being who was not only responsible for its
  decisions, but responsible for having the sort of character that would
  make those decisions? For that matter, how could an indeterministic
  process from the same starting point yield anything better?
* Perhaps the error is this: it presupposes that one could not take full
  responsibility for something unless it was entirely of one's making.
* In what ways are we products of acts of self-creation then?
* However much one considers and evaluates and reflects, there is always
  logical room for more. Since we are thus inevitably confronted with the
  need for a limited and incomplete survey of considerations, it becomes
  important to us that the “right” considerations occur to us *early* in the
  deliberation process. But we cannot directly control this ordering; we
  cannot play parade marshal for the queue of considerations-to-be-reviewed,
  putting each in its proper place in line. For such control takes time and
  effort, and we are rushed. We must relinquish control over the very
  process that generates the incomplete set of considerations on which we
  act, and hence we are always somewhat at the mercy of that process.
  However, knowing that we are and always will be at the mercy of that
  process, we can take steps to improve—if not guarantee—its reliability.
* But even this process of reflective self-criticism and meta-level control
  reasoning must have its limits. If a complacent or sphexish rejection of
  all opportunities for reflection would be ill-advised, it would clearly
  also be irrational to embark on a limitless round of self-evaluation.
* Why are we inclined to think, then, that further level of reflection,
  further bouts of self-evaluation, *tend* to lead to improvements in the
  “character” of the agent?
* One can see that up to some ill-defined point, the acquisition of
  self-knowledge must be a good thing. A necessary feature of this task of
  self-evaluation is that it has no objective upper bound but at the same
  time gets more difficult the higher up the evaluation proceeds.
* Finite agents must use heuristic methods when faced with large problems
  and limited time (and other resources). The larger the search space of a
  problem, the larger and messier the haystack in which the needle must be
  found, the more risky any heuristic method (with its inevitably blind
  leaps) must be.
* Self-formation represents the gradual development of self to be
  importantly unlike other process of material transformation that might
  seem to be appropriate metaphors to those hylephobes (hylephobia is
  Dennet's term for the fear of materialism) with lazy imaginations: crystal
  formation, erosion, ripening, the formation of scar tissue.
  Self-formation, unlike these, is informationally sensitive, amenable to
  indefinitely many levels of meta-level criticism, and “creative” in the
  way that art is: the forms that emerge contribute to the constitution of
  the canons by which they are judged.
* This proposition is still vulnerable to a version of Edwards' skeptical
  challenge: if I happen to have defined myself so as to be able to listen
  to the voice of reason (on occasion) that is just my good luck, and if
  another person is unlucky enough to start life with a character tainted by
  ancestral shortcomings, his misdeeds are similarly only a product of his
  bad luck. Neither of us was responsible for being who we were the day we
  were born, and neither of us is, or could be, responsible for anything we
  subsequently do, so long as our characters today are deterministic
  outgrowths, however constructive or creative, of our characters yesterday
  and the day before.
* Is it “just luck” that some of us were born with enough artistic talent,
  in effect, to have developed “good” characters while some of us have
  turned out less well?
* Further Dennett talks at length about luck, but in my opinion this does
  not advance the discussion at all. He calls fortunate events in the
  causation chain “luck” and unfortunate “bad luck”. Further he says that
  what is considered lucky varies per individual and their “skill level”,
  etc. A pretty useless section.

## 5. Acting under the idea of freedom

* If determinism is true, then any belief we ever have about there being
  more than one possible future for us is false. If determinism is true,
  then only the actual is possible; whatever did happen was the only thing
  that could have happened, and whatever will happen will be the sole
  possibility the future ever held in store for us. But then, since
  deliberation surely presupposes that there are multiple possibilities to
  be decided amongst, determinism and deliberation are incompatible. But
  what could this supposed incompatibility come to?
* If determinism were true, people sometimes say, deliberation would be
  impossible. But this cannot be right. People deliberate every day. What is
  actual is possible, but this manifest actuality of deliberation hardly
  shows that determinism is false.
* If determinism were true, the deliberation that people engage in wouldn't
  be *effective* deliberation, wouldn't “make any difference”. If we think
  of making a difference as simply *being efficacious*, this must also be
  false. Even in a perfectly determined world there is plenty of room for a
  distinction between bouts of deliberation that contribute importantly to
  the causation of an event deliberated about and bouts of deliberation that
  are without important issue. (Rather obvious examples follow.)
* However effective such determined deliberation might be in contributing to
  a casual chain, it wouldn't be *real* deliberation, since its outcome
  would be just as determined as its inauguration. But why is this the mark
  of phony, unreal deliberation? Wouldn't a determined thunderstorm be a
  real thunderstorm? Wouldn't a determined traffic accident be a real
  traffic accident?
* Dennett urges us not to confuse determinism with fatalism—a rather
  mystical and superstitious view that at certain checkpoints in our lives,
  we will necessarily find ourselves in particular circumstances no matter
  what the intervening vagaries of our personal trajectories are.
  Determinism does not imply fatalism.
* Local fatalism might be true, e.g. no deliberation could make any
  difference if the person deliberating is falling off a bridge.
* We cannot help acting under the idea of freedom, it seems; we are stuck
  deliberating as if our futures were open. But is there anything to
  criticize or regret in this irresistible proclivity of ours? We may be
  able to assess the rationality or wisdom behind our way of deliberating by
  taking Mother Nature's view of us—or what comes to the same thing: by
  asking what constraints there are on the design of a finite, physical
  deliberator.
* In what follows Dennett talks in detail about the design of a physically
  implementable deliberator, what kind of trade-offs it could make and when.
  The main point is this: for a physical deliberator there is really no
  other way to come to its conclusions (on which its very existence often
  depends!) but do to the actual deliberation. There is no shortcuts. Thus,
  even if determinism is true, we have to deliberate as if the future is not
  fixed in order to behave intelligently.
* The little chapter on opportunities does not really add much new or
  interesting. Its focal point, it seems, is the comparison between
  pseudo-randomness (as implemented e.g. in programming languages) and true
  randomness (as implemented e.g. by an actual Geiger counter). Dennett
  highlights that opportunities that are enabled by either type of
  randomness are genuine opportunities. For example, a lottery where the
  numbers are drawn even before the tickets are sold is still fair in the
  same way as a lottery where they draw the numbers after selling all the
  tickets. This thought hardly needed a chapter of its own—it is obvious.
* Next, Dennett considers the notions of ‘avoidable’ and ‘inevitable’.
  Dennet: If determinism is true, all our acts are inevitable, because they
  are the inevitable effects of events in the past that are themselves quite
  beyond revision. This line of reasoning is as familiar as it is
  incoherent. It involves illicit slide from “determined” or “casually
  necessary” to “inevitable”.
* We view world, when we are deliberating and planning, always in terms of
  those features of the world that are going to continue “normally” and
  those that might change or will change or that we plan to change or hope
  to change. We categorize some of those projected things as things that
  will happen *unless* we take certain steps, and others as things that will
  happen *because* we will take certain steps, and some of them as things
  that will happen *no matter what steps we take*. We call the latter
  “inevitable”, because nothing *we do* makes any difference to them, and
  hence it is pointless to deliberate about them. This is what “inevitable”
  means.

## 6. “Could have done otherwise”

* Dennett argues that one could take a strong moral stance in a particular
  situation so that they truly would not do otherwise in that situation.
  This is however not regarded as devoid of free will; quite the opposite—it
  is praised in our culture.
* What good would it do to know, about a particular agent, that on some
  occasion (or on every occasion) he could have done otherwise than he did?
  Or that he could not have done otherwise than he did? Let us take the
  latter case first. Suppose you knew that when Jones pulled the trigger and
  murdered his wife at time *t*, he could *not* have done otherwise. That
  is, given Jones' microstate at *t* and the complete microstate of Jones'
  environment (including the gravitational effects of distant stars, and so
  on) at *t*, no other Jones-trajectory was possible than the trajectory he
  took. If Jones were ever put back into exactly that state again, in
  exactly that circumstance, he would pull the trigger again. And if he were
  put in that state a million times, he would pull the trigger a million
  times.

  Now if you learned this, would you have learned anything about Jones?
  Would you have learned anything about his character, for instance, or his
  likely behavior on merely similar occasions? No. Although people are
  physical objects which, like atoms or ball bearings or bridges, obey the
  laws of physics, they are not only more complicated than anything else we
  know in the universe, they are also designed to be so sensitive to the
  passing show that they never can be in the same microstate twice. One
  doesn't even have to descend to the atomic level to establish this. People
  learn, and remember, and get bored, and shift their attention, and change
  their interests so incessantly, that it is as good as infinitely unlikely
  that any person is ever in the same (gross) *psychological* or *cognitive*
  state on two occasions. And this would be true even if we engineered the
  surrounding environment to be “utterly the same” on different occasions—if
  only because the second time around the agent would no doubt think
  something that went unthought the first time, like “Oh my, this all seems
  so utterly familiar; now what did I do last time?”

  There is some point in determining how a bridge is caused to react to some
  very accurately specified circumstances, since those may be circumstances
  it will actually encounter *in its present state* on a future occasion.
  But there would be no payoff in understanding to be gained by determining
  the micro-causation of the behavior of a human being in some particular
  circumstance, since he will certainly never confront that
  micro-circumstance again, and even if he did, he would certainly be in a
  significantly different reactive state at the time.

  Learning that a particular agent was *not* thus determined to act would be
  learning something equally idle, from the point of view of character
  assessment or planning for the future. The undetermined agent will be no
  more flexible, no move versatile, no more sensitive to nuances, no more
  reformable, than his deterministic cousin.
* Why should determinism still seem so appalling? Is that what we want—to
  have our cake and eat it too? To have chosen *both* to marry and to remain
  unmarried, *both* to pull the trigger and to drop the gun? If that is the
  variety of free will we want, then whether or not it might be worth
  wanting, we can be quite confident that it must elude us.
* If we let go of that fantasy and ask what we really, soberly want, we find
  a more modest hope: while there are indeed times when we would give
  anything to be able to go back and undo something in the past, we
  recognize that the past is closed for us, and we would gladly settle for
  an “open future”. But what would an open future be? A future in which our
  deliberation is effective: a future in which if I decide to do A then I
  will do A, and if I decide to do B then I will do B; a future in
  which—since only one future is possible—the only possible thing that can
  happen is the thing I decide in the end to do.
* Next, Dennett considers another meaning of “could have done otherwise”. He
  takes it to mean “what could be reasonably improved in one's behavior”. A
  not very exciting angle.
* MK: I think all this “could have done otherwise” theme originates from the
  simple consideration of whether or not the agent in question actually had
  more than one *reasonable* choice to choose from. And by “reasonable” I
  mean such a choice that is feasible to make and does not involve
  unacceptable consequences. Let us see if Dennett addresses this in the
  rest of the chapter.
* Under determinism *nothing* can do anything other than what it in fact
  does. The conclusion must be that in a deterministic world, since an atom
  of oxygen that never links up with any hydrogen atoms is determined never
  to link up with any hydrogen atoms, it is physically *impossible* for it
  to link up with any hydrogen atoms. In what sense, then, could it be true
  that it, like any oxygen atom, *can* link up with two hydrogen atoms?
* Ayers calls this threatened implication of determinism “actualism”—only
  the actual is possible. Something is surely wrong with actualism.
* Hume speaks of “a certain looseness” we want to exist in our world. This
  is the looseness that prevents the possible from shrinking tightly around
  the actual, the looseness presupposed by our use of the word “can”.
* Honoré proposes that we distinguish between two senses of “can”: “can”
  (particular) and “can” (general)—and notes that the particular sense is
  almost degenerate: it “is almost equivalent to ‘will’ and has predictive
  force.” In the past tense, particular “can” is only appropriate for
  describing success: “Thus ‘I could see you in the undergrowth’ is properly
  said only when I have succeeded in seeing you.”

  The more useful notion of “can” (general), which in the case of an agent
  imputes skill or ability, and in the case of an inanimate thing, imputes a
  kind of potentiality (for example, the different states that something can
  be in). But that sense of “can” is a manifestly epistemic notion; that is,
  it is generated by any self-controlling planner's need to partition the
  world into those things and their “states” that are all
  possible-for-all-it-knows.
* Philosophical tradition distinguishes several varieties of possibility:
  1. *Logical* or “alethic” possibility: the complement of logical
     impossibility; something is logically possible if it is consistently
     describable; it is logically possible that there is a unicorn in the
     garden, but (if the biologists are right) it is not biologically or
     physically possible.
  2. *Physical* or “nomic” possibility: something is physically possible if
     it does not violate the laws of physics or the laws of nature (*nomos*
     = law, in Greek). It is physically impossible to travel faster than the
     speed of light, even though one can describe such a feat without
     contradicting oneself.
  3. *Epistemic* possibility: something is epistemically possible *for
     Jones* if it is consistent with everything Jones already *knows*. So
     epistemic possibility is generally viewed as subjective and relative,
     unlike logical and physical possibility, which are deemed entirely
     objective.
* It is a shame that philosophers have not been concerned with epistemic
  possibility, for it is the key to the resolution of the riddle about
  “can”. The useful notion of “can”, the notion that is relied upon not only
  in personal planning and deliberation, but also in science, is a concept
  of possibility—and with it, of course, interdefined concepts of
  impossibility and necessity—that are, contrary to first appearances,
  fundamentally “epistemic”.
* [Epistemic] concepts of necessity and possibility obey different modal
  principles from the concept of “classical” alethic necessity. In
  particular, such necessity is not “agglomerative”, by which Slote means
  closed with respect to conjunction introduction. Slote illustrates the
  concept with an example of an “accidential” meeting: Jules happens to meet
  his friend Jim at the bank; he thinks it is happy accident, as indeed it
  is. But Jules' being at the bank is not an accident, since he always goes
  there on Wednesday morning as part of his job; and Jim's being there is
  also no accident, since he has been sent by his superior. That Jules is at
  L at time t is no accident; that Jim is at L at time t is no accident. But
  that Jules is at L at time t *and* Jim is at L at time t—*that* is an
  accident.
* This is apparently accidentality or coincidentality
  from-a-limited-point-of-view. We imagine that if we knew much, much more
  than Jules and Jim together know, we would have been able to predict their
  convergence at the bank; *to us*, their meeting would have been “no
  accident”. But this is just the concept of accidentality we need to
  describe the “independence” of a thing's powers or abilities from the
  initial conditions or background conditions in which those powers are
  exercised.
* The trajectory of a pinball after bumping, say, twenty posts (in a few
  seconds) is unpredictable *in the limit*, far outstripping the limits of
  accuracy of any imaginable observation devices. Now this result is surely
  “just epistemic.” What could it have to do with free will?
* Such chaotic systems are the source of the “practical” independence of
  things that shuffles the world and makes it a place of continual
  opportunity. The opportunities provided are not just *our* opportunities,
  but also those of Mother Nature—and of oxygen atoms which can join forces
  on occasion with hydrogen atoms. It is not any parochial fact about *our*
  epistemic limitations that distinguishes the world into stable,
  predictable systems and unstable, chaotic systems; it is a fact about the
  world itself—because it is a factor about the world's predictability by
  any predicting system at all, however powerful.

## 7. Why do we want free will?

* The varieties of free will we deem worth wanting are those—if there are
  any—that will secure for us our dignity and responsibility.
* It is interesting that when people hit upon the suggestion that there may
  be no responsibility, they do not as a rule view it as the prospect of a
  welcome holiday, a change to do whatever they like without running the
  risk of feeling—or being—guilty. Strangely enough, it seems that we want
  to be held responsible. Why?
* Perhaps our dignity is threatened by the prospect that we ourselves might
  not be responsible agents. What is this *dignity* that is so special?
* Perhaps there are other reasons for our allegiance? How should we
  interpret the fact that we want to hold others responsible? But why? Could
  it be a streak of sheer vindictiveness or vengefulness in us, rationalized
  and made presentable in civilized company by a gloss by moral doctrine?
* It is *rational* for us to esteem free will and covet responsibility. No
  other sort of argument could be a *defense* of those concepts;
  nevertheless, such an argument must inevitably appear to be
  question-begging in its appeal to the rational judgment of an audience of
  fellow agents.
* (Here Dennett starts considering nihilism.) If it were true that we ought
  to take the possibility of nihilism that seriously, then nihilism would be
  false, for if we *ought* to do *anything* nihilism is false. But then we
  may as well assume that it is false, since either it is false or, if it
  isn't, nothing matters and we may do whatever we want. Nihilism is, quite
  literally, a *negligible* position.
* Since there could be nothing better to do, we might just as well affirm
  our confidence in our starting point. We may assume that something
  matters, and that we are rational enough so that there can be a point to
  our attempts to understand the world. I do not see how those assumptions
  could be coherently criticized—which is not to say that they must be true.

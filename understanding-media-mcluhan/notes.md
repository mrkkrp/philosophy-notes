## 1. The medium is the message

* The medium is the message. The author admits that the statement is
  shocking, but perhaps it is not so shocking if we also take into account a
  rather peculiar definition of *message* that McLuhan gives us.
* ‘Message’ of any medium or technology is the change of scale or page or
  pattern that it introduces into human affairs. Then, we can rephrase his
  famous definition as ‘the medium is the change it introduces into human
  affairs’. Not so shocking anymore. I guess the shocking part comes from
  the fact that we are not used to think of message of a medium per se,
  separate from the message that is associated with the content that medium
  propagates. I'm not even sure the word *message* is the best one for what
  McLuhan means here.
* Content of any medium is always another medium. The content of writing is
  speech, just as the written word is the content of print, and print is the
  content of the telegraph. What is the content of speech? It is an actual
  process of thought, which is itself nonverbal. That's questionable that it
  is nonverbal, but perhaps not important.
* So, a medium has 2 things: the message and the content. They are quite
  indepedent for McLuhan even though intuitively we would rather equate
  them.
* ‘Only standing aside from any structure or medium that its principles and
  lines of force can be discerned. For any medium has the power of imposing
  its own assumption on the unwary.’
* ‘Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are
  used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the
  “content” of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the
  burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind. The effect of the medium is
  made strong and intense just because it is given another medium as
  “content”. The content of a movie is a novel or a play or an opera. The
  effect of the movie form is not related to its program content.’
* ‘The effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or
  concepts, but alter sense ratios or patterns of perception steadily and
  without any resistance. The serious artist is the only person able to
  encounter technology with impunity, just because he is an expert aware of
  the changes in sense perception.’
